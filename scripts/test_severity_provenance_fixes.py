"""Regression tests for the DODO May-2026 report_index provenance halt fix.

Root cause: three independent driver bugs in expected-severity computation
flagged the LLM's correct report_index output as "silent severity change":

1. `_enforce_severity_matrix` asymmetric verifier-vs-matrix rule
   The function respected verifier's explicit Severity ONLY when LOWER
   than the matrix computation. When the matrix accidentally inflated
   (e.g. false-positive `fully-trusted` modifier match from PROSE the
   verifier explicitly REJECTED), the matrix value won over the
   verifier's explicit High → driver expected Medium → LLM wrote High
   (correct per verifier) → provenance gate halted.
   Fix: explicit verifier severity is authoritative in BOTH directions.

2. PARTIAL/UNRESOLVED auto-demotion in `_expected_report_index_severities`
   Driver demoted Medium → Low on PARTIAL verdict even when the verifier
   had ALREADY explicitly assigned Severity: Medium with the partial
   context in mind. Caused INV-128 false-fail.
   Fix: only auto-demote when verifier did NOT assign explicit Severity.

3. Inline adjustment notation in verifier Severity field
   Verifier wrote `Severity: High (adjusted to Medium — external
   precondition required)`. Parser read "High" (first token). Verifier
   intent was Medium. LLM correctly wrote Medium → provenance gate
   misclassified as LLM-fault.
   Fix: `_extract_verifier_severity_with_adjustment` recognizes the
   common "X (adjusted to Y)" and "X → Y" idioms and returns Y.

These tests lock all three fixes against regression. Without them, any
future audit hitting the same idioms would burn another opus-tier
report_index retry storm before halting.
