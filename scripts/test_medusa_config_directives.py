"""Contract tests for the Medusa campaign prompt updates.

Background: the Medusa stateful-fuzz campaign was historically configured
with Medusa's default `stopOnFailedTest: true`, which halts the entire
campaign at the first invariant violation. The DODO Crosschain Dex
Thorough audit (May 2026) demonstrated the impact: MEDUSA-1 fired in
<1 second, the remaining ~24 invariants never got the deep-state
exploration they needed, and the configured 15-minute budget was
effectively wasted.

The fix changes two things in both EVM Medusa prompt files
(`prompts/evm/v2/phase4b-medusa-fuzz.md` and `prompts/evm/phase4b-loop.md`):
  1. Add explicit `stopOnFailedTest: false` directive in the medusa.json
     config the agent generates.
  2. Cut the per-campaign timeout from 900s → 600s. The campaign now
     runs the full budget across all invariants (rather than halting
     at the first failure), so the total wall time is unchanged or
     slightly reduced while coverage improves.
  3. Add a STEP 3a dedup directive so the agent collapses multiple
     witnesses of the same root cause into a single MEDUSA-N finding
     instead of emitting one per counterexample.

These tests lock in the prompt contract. Drift in either file
(forgetting `stopOnFailedTest: false`, regressing back to 900s, or
losing the dedup directive) gets caught immediately by CI.
