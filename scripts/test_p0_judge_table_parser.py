"""Tests for v2.0.5 P0 — judge table parser + judge_decisions.json sidecar.

Covers:
  P0.1  _parse_skeptic_judge_table (in plamen_parsers)
        _collect_judge_unresolved_ids table-parse strategy
        _collect_judge_downgrade_map shared-parser refactor
  P0.2  write_judge_decisions_json_sidecar (in plamen_parsers)
        read_judge_decisions_json_sidecar
        consumer precedence (JSON-when-fresh, MD-fallback)

The DODO 2026-05-21 halt was caused by the parser/prompt schema drift —
prompt produced table format; parser required H2 sections; UNRESOLVED set
was empty; report_index authenticity gate halted. Fixtures here are
synthetic (NOT DODO-scratchpad copies) to avoid overfitting.
