"""Regression test for the spawn_manifest validator's prose-tolerance fix.

Background: DODO May-2026 audit halt at Phase 2 (instantiate). The LLM
produced a structurally-correct spawn_manifest.md AGENT table with no
forbidden artifacts, then added a helpful `## Phase 3b/3c Artifacts
(NOT breadth AGENT rows)` section in PROSE bullet points to explicitly
clarify what wasn't in the table. The pre-fix validator scanned the
whole file for forbidden filenames and got false-positives on the
prose mentions.

Fix scopes the scan to actual markdown table rows (lines starting and
containing `|` separators), so prose bullets and explanatory paragraphs
are ignored.

These tests lock in:
  - Prose mentions of forbidden filenames don't trigger the gate
  - Forbidden filenames in actual table ROWS still trigger the gate
