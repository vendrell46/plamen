"""Regression test for the rate-limit-retry savings guard.

Background: when a phase's attempt-1 subprocess is rate-limited DURING the
streaming response AFTER its expected_artifacts have already been written
to disk (common for rescan/inventory phases that finalize files mid-stream
before the end-of-turn token), the rate-limit retry path historically
fired `run_phase(attempt=2)` unconditionally — a full re-run that produced
the same artifacts at a fresh model spend (~$10-12 per Thorough rescan).

The DODO Crosschain Dex Thorough audit (May 2026) demonstrated this:
rescan attempt-1 wrote all 4 expected files BEFORE the 429 hit, then
attempt-2 re-wrote them at $11.96 of pure waste.

The fix adds a `gate_passes()` pre-check before each rate-limit retry
spawn. If attempt 1 already satisfied the phase's expected_artifacts
contract, skip the spawn entirely (rc=0) and let downstream validators
mark the phase complete normally.

These tests verify the helper logic (gate_passes integration) using a
synthesized scratchpad. Full integration is covered by the live audit
ledger after the change ships.
