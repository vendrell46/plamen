"""V1→V2 phase wiring drift detector.

Background: the DODO May-2026 audit recall regression vs the v1.0.5
benchmark was traced to THREE phases that were documented in V1's
mode matrix + prompts but never wired into V2's deterministic driver:

  - Phase 4a.5 Pass 2 (Recursive Semantic Gap Trace) — Thorough
  - Phase 4c iteration 2 (Chain Composition) — Thorough
  - Phase 5.5 (Post-Verification Finding Extraction) — Thorough

All three had inline spawn templates in `commands/plamen.md` AND mode
matrix references, but no `Phase(...)` entry in `SC_PHASES`/`L1_PHASES`.
The V2 driver section-extracts phase sections by Phase entry; if no
Phase entry exists, the content is dead code.

This test enumerates ALL ## Phase / ## Step section headings in
`commands/plamen.md` and reports any that have no matching Phase
section_marker. Default: WARN (does not fail the test) — the user
direction is "consistent structure that does not halt future
improvements." If a future audit reveals another orphaned phase, the
warning will surface it without blocking development. If you want
strict CI enforcement, set PLAMEN_STRICT_PHASE_WIRING=1 in the test
environment.

NOTE: Many ## Step N headings are setup/wizard sub-sections that V2's
Python driver handles natively and don't need section_markers. The
heuristic filters to plausible PIPELINE phases only (Phase N pattern,
plus Step 4+ which are V1's "pipeline" steps; Step 0-3 are wizard).
