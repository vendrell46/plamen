"""Lock-in tests for orchestrator HARD STOP termination contracts.

Background: the DODO May-2026 audit's breadth phase took 1h06m wall-time
even though the last legitimate output was written at 30:04. The LLM
orchestrator inside the breadth subprocess produced its 6 required
analysis files in the first 30 minutes, then kept running for another
36 minutes producing future-phase artifacts (e.g. `analysis_rescan_2.md`)
that the driver's phase-isolation layer quarantined and discarded.

Root cause: the breadth + rescan prompts had no explicit termination
contract for the ORCHESTRATOR agent (only for sub-agents). With no
"return immediately when done" signal, the LLM stayed helpful and
started downstream-phase work. The driver waited for natural subprocess
exit — token waste, wall-time waste, session-quota waste.

The fix adds an explicit HARD STOP "Orchestrator Termination Contract"
section to both prompts: enumerates the prohibitions (do NOT write
later-phase artifacts) and gives a literal return signal format.

These tests guarantee both contracts stay in place — if a future edit
removes them, the audit will regress to the same wall-time bloat.
