"""Regression tests for the empty-tier validator self-heal from body marker.

Background: `_maybe_skip_empty_body_writer` is the driver's deterministic
path for tier shards with zero findings. It writes BOTH:
  1. The tier body file (e.g. `report_medium_c.md`) containing an
     authentic empty-tier note with `PLAMEN-DRIVER-AUTHENTIC-EMPTY-TIER`
     as a provenance marker in the body text.
  2. A JSON sidecar (`body_manifests/<shard>.empty.json`) with the same
     auth marker.

If the sidecar write fails silently (FS error, permission, parallel
sweep race), the body file is still on disk and is still authentic.
Pre-fix, the legacy tier confirmation handler `report_<tier>_<shard>`
would FAIL the validator because the sidecar was missing, even though
the body file's marker was right there. This halted the entire audit.

The DODO May-2026 audit hit this exact failure mode at phase 42
(`report_medium_c`) — the medium tier had no findings in shard c, the
body-writer skip wrote `report_medium_c.md` with the marker but the
sidecar `body_manifests/report_medium_c.empty.json` was missing on disk.
Pipeline halted with "body validator: manifest report_medium_c.json
missing for report_medium_c.md."

Post-fix: `_empty_tier_sidecar_valid` accepts EITHER the sidecar OR the
body file's authoritative marker. Both routes still cross-check that
`expected_tier_assignment_count == 0` so impostors are rejected.
