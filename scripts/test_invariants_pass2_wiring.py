"""Wiring + soft-validation tests for Phase 4a.5 Pass 2.

V1 ran a two-pass Semantic Invariant phase in Thorough mode. The V1→V2
deterministic-driver refactor dropped the Pass 2 phase definition while
leaving five separate documentation references and the prompt file
intact (in V1 path). The DODO May-2026 audit confirmed Pass 2 never ran
in our V2 Thorough audit — `semantic_invariants.md` had only `Phase
4a.5 Pass 1` content. v1.0.5 benchmark's PROCESS_LOG describes Pass 2
specifically catching GT-M-06 (ETH sentinel `safeTransfer` DoS) — a
finding the v2 audit MISSED.

These tests lock in the Pass 2 wiring:

  1. The standalone prompt for Pass 2 is mapped in
     `_STANDALONE_PROMPT_MAP`.
  2. The Phase entry exists in BOTH SC_PHASES and L1_PHASES.
  3. Pass 2 is mode-gated to Thorough only (Core/Light skip).
  4. The validator is SOFT — never returns hard issues / never halts.
  5. Missing Pass 2 output writes a degraded sentinel; pipeline proceeds.
  6. Present Pass 2 output passes the validator cleanly.

These guards prevent the same V1→V2 wiring regression from happening
again on this phase.
