This phase may coordinate recon workers, but the final handoff is not optional

substantive draft. A substantive draft may say `UNAVAILABLE` or `NOT DETECTED`

Required recon artifacts:
{required}

Finalization rules:
1. Treat mechanical pre-pass files as seeds. You may overwrite or enrich any
   recon artifact seeded by pre-pass if the result is more accurate.
2. `detected_patterns.md`, `setter_list.md`, and `emit_list.md` are first-class
   required outputs, not optional appendix files.
3. `build_status.md` must record attempted build/static-analysis commands or
   the explicit reason they were unavailable/skipped.
4. `recon_summary.md` must be a clean downstream handoff: target, language,
   scope, key components, detected patterns, risk themes, selected templates,
   and produced artifact list.
5. Do not leave `TODO`, `TBD`, `[LLM TO ...]`, placeholder text, or draft-only
   markers in any required recon artifact.

# v2.1.4: pre-flight prompt-gate consistency check.
#
# Catches the Class-B drift category (prompt and gate reference different
# filenames) BEFORE the subprocess spawns -- rather than discovering the
# mismatch after a 30-60 minute phase run. When the extracted V1 prompt
# contains a filename-like token that does NOT match any of the phase's
# canonical patterns (expected_artifacts + any_of groups + a conservative
# allowlist of legitimately-produced-but-not-gate-checked names like
# blind_spot_* / niche_* / design_stress_*), we log a warning pointing at
# the conflict so it can be repaired at the prompt source.
#
# SOFT by design: never fails the phase, only logs. Prompt authors may
# legitimately reference older / alternate / documentation-only names in
# prose. Hard-failing here would regress false-positive a lot. The signal
# is valuable for post-run audit + future pipeline versions.
# Allowlist of filename patterns that may legitimately appear in prompts
# but aren't in any phase's `expected_artifacts`. These are subproducer
# outputs (scanner / niche / DA / design-stress agents run inside a
# parent phase subprocess; their files exist but aren't gate-checked at
# the phase level). Also literal secondary artifacts consumed by later
# phases. Any filename pattern NOT in this list and NOT in the current
# phase's expected_artifacts triggers a consistency warning.

## BODY-WRITER PHASE OVERRIDE

You are the body writer for shard `{shard_key}`. Your ONLY output is
`{out_file}`. The driver has already produced the deterministic structure
(IDs, severities, locations, dedup, exclusions) in the per-shard manifest
at `{manifest_rel}`. That manifest is your SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for
which findings to write.

## Inputs (READ ONLY)

1. `{manifest_rel}` -- the authoritative list of findings you must write up.
   Every entry has: `report_id`, `finding_id`, `severity`, `title`,
   `location`, `evidence_tag`, `verify_file`, `verify_files`, `description`,
   `recommendation`, `report_blocked`. The `description` and
   `recommendation` fields contain the verifier's own narrative -- use them
   as substance and rephrase for clarity, do not invent new claims.
2. The `verify_files` referenced for each manifest entry -- only when the
   manifest's `description`/`recommendation` need additional context. For
   consolidated findings, read every file in `verify_files` and preserve each
   distinct proven location/impact in the body without exposing internal IDs.
3. Cited source files, line-bounded -- only when you need to inline a
   short code excerpt the verifier already proved.

DO NOT read `report_index.md`, `findings_inventory.md`, `hypotheses.md`,
depth or scanner artifacts, or any verify file not referenced by your manifest.
The manifest already contains every field you need; `report_index.md` lists
ALL findings across all shards and reading it causes scope violations.

## Output rules

- Write ONLY `{out_file}`.
- Cover EVERY finding in the manifest. Missing one is a hard halt.
- Write NOTHING outside the manifest. Inventing a report ID is a hard halt.
- Use the `report_id` from the manifest as the finding section heading
  (`### [<report_id>] <title>`). Preserve the severity ordering implied by
  the manifest.
- Each finding section MUST include: Severity, Location (verbatim from
  the manifest), Description (rephrased substance from
  `description` + `verify_files`), Impact (derived from the verifier's
  Impact line and the cited postcondition), Evidence Tag (verbatim from
  the manifest), and Recommendation (rephrased substance from
  `recommendation`).
- For any manifest entry whose `report_blocked` is `true`, prefix the
  section heading with `[REPORT-BLOCKED: insufficient evidence]` and use
  conservative prose -- do NOT speculate to fill the gap.
- No internal pipeline IDs in the prose (no `INV-NNN`, no `BLIND-N`,
  no `[CC-N]`, etc.). Use only the `report_id`.

## Acceptance gate

After you write `{out_file}`, the driver runs
`_validate_tier_body_against_manifest`. It will halt the pipeline if
your file is missing any manifest entry, contains any extra report IDs,
references any location not in the manifest, or omits the
`[REPORT-BLOCKED: ...]` tag for blocked findings. There is no Python
prose fallback -- the only escape is an explicit BODY-WRITER-DEGRADED
artifact written by the driver after a hard halt.

## BREADTH PHASE OVERRIDE

Run ONLY the breadth analysis phase.

Output ownership:
- Your only valid outputs are manifest-derived breadth files named
  `analysis_<focus_area>.md`.
- Do not create any other artifact family. Files outside the manifest-derived
  breadth set are ignored by the breadth gate and are moved aside by the
  phase-boundary checker.
- When all required breadth files exist and are substantial, stop immediately.

Manifest completion loop:
1. Read `spawn_manifest.md` first.
2. For every required spawned breadth-agent row in `spawn_manifest.md`, derive
   its expected output file as `analysis_<focus_area>.md` unless the manifest
   explicitly names an output file. Ignore rows whose type/status/role says
   `skill`, `injectable`, `template`, `methodology`, `checklist`, `binding`,
   `merged into ...`, `covered by ...`, or `no separate agent`; those rows
   modify an agent prompt and do not own standalone `analysis_*.md` files.
3. Build COMPLETE_OUTPUTS from expected files that exist and are >=200 bytes.
4. Build OPEN_OUTPUTS from expected files that are missing or <200 bytes.
   File existence/size is authoritative; ignore stale COMPLETE/PENDING text
   in the manifest Status column.
5. If OPEN_OUTPUTS is non-empty, spawn ONLY those missing or stub breadth
   agents. Do not spawn all agents again.
6. Spawn OPEN_OUTPUTS in bounded batches of at most 6 parallel Task calls.
   If 7+ outputs are open, wait for the first batch, close completed agents,
   then return to step 3 before spawning the next batch.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until OPEN_OUTPUTS is empty.
8. Each breadth agent writes exactly one `analysis_<focus_area>.md` file and
   then stops.

Do not consider a returned batch to mean the phase is complete. Completion is
manifest-exact, not batch-exact. Never return with 7/12, 9/12, or any partial
manifest completion.

The gate counts only valid breadth outputs. Non-manifest `analysis_*` files
are not counted.

## INVENTORY SHARD OBJECTIVE

This is an inventory shard phase. Read ONLY these analysis artifacts:
- {files}
{l1_inventory_note}

Write ONLY `{output}`.

Output format requirements for EVERY shard finding:
- heading style: `### Finding [CC-N]: <title>` (CC-N = Consolidated Chunk ID,
  numbered sequentially from CC-01 within THIS shard; driver downstream
  parses CC-\\d+ as a valid internal ID)
- include explicit `**Source IDs**:` containing the original upstream IDs
- include `**Severity**:`, `**Location**:`, and `**Preferred Tag**:`
- preserve the original source IDs even if you rename the local shard ID

ID PRESERVATION RULE: The global "no internal IDs in the client-facing
report body" rule in rules/report-template.md does NOT apply to this
intermediate artifact. CC-N and upstream source IDs MUST appear here --
they are the contract the downstream inventory-merge and report-index
phases rely on to map shard output back to report IDs. ID stripping
happens ONLY in the tier-writer phases (report_critical_high, report_medium_*,
report_low_info), not here and not in any `*_assignments.md`
manifest.

Execution model:
- Do this work directly in this subprocess. Do NOT spawn Task subagents.
- Read the assigned files one at a time. They are the only large inputs you
  need, and they are already shard-bounded by the driver.
- Do NOT create shell/Python helper scripts or temporary `/tmp` files to
  assemble the final artifact. Write the final markdown artifact directly.
- Do NOT run tests, invoke external tools, or inspect source files. This phase
  consolidates already-written analysis artifacts only.

Required file structure:
1. `## Source Summary` with one row for every assigned input file and a final
   total row.
2. `## Master Table` with one row for every local CC finding.
3. `## Per-Finding Detail` with one `### Finding [CC-NN]: <title>` block for
   every row in the master table.

Every detail block must include:
- `**Source IDs**:`
- `**Severity**:`
- `**Location**:`
- `**Preferred Tag**:`
- `**Verdict**:`
- `**Root Cause**:`
- `**Description**:`
- `**Impact**:`

Use this exact detail-block skeleton for every finding; do not omit any field
and do not substitute another section for it:

```markdown
### Finding [CC-NN]: <title>

**Source IDs**: <source IDs>
**Severity**: <Critical|High|Medium|Low|Informational>
**Location**: <file:line or N/A>
**Preferred Tag**: <tag>
**Verdict**: <CONFIRMED|PARTIAL|REFUTED|INFO>
**Root Cause**: <why the issue exists, or why it is blocked>
**Description**: <what happens and the relevant evidence>
**Impact**: <security/economic/operational effect; for PARTIAL, REFUTED,
or Informational findings, explicitly state the blocked or residual impact>
```

`**Impact**:` is mandatory even when the verdict is PARTIAL, REFUTED, or
Informational. Precondition analysis may appear only after the mandatory
fields; it does not replace `**Impact**:`. Never end a finding block after
`Precondition Analysis` without a separate `**Impact**:` line in that same
block.

Completion checklist before returning:
- Count master-table rows and detail headings. They must be equal.
- For every `### Finding [CC-NN]` block, verify the block contains a literal
  `**Impact**:` line. If any block lacks it, fix the block before returning.
- Every source ID that appears in a source finding is either listed in exactly
  one detail block or explicitly listed in the Source Summary as deduplicated
  into another CC finding.
- The only file you wrote is `{output}`.

Do local dedup only within this shard. Do not read unrelated `analysis_*.md`
files.

**FORBIDDEN FILES** (v2.0.4 — derived mechanically from the inventory
phase graph; writing any of these triggers a phase containment violation):

- `findings_inventory.md` — owned by the later inventory-merge phase.
- `findings_inventory_chunk_a.md`, `findings_inventory_chunk_b.md`,
  `findings_inventory_chunk_c.md` (every chunk OTHER than `{output}`) —
  owned by sibling `inventory_chunk_*` phases. The driver may ADOPT a
  valid sibling chunk if you accidentally write one, but the safest
  path is to write ONLY `{output}` and stop.
- `semantic_invariants.md` — owned by the later `invariants` phase
  (Phase 4a.5).

If your assigned input set tempts you to keep working past your own
chunk's checklist, STOP. Each sibling chunk has its own assigned input
set and its own subprocess. Cross-chunk dedup happens in the merge
phase, not here.

After the checklist passes, return one line and stop.

## VERIFY COST OVERRIDE

Verification was a dominant token sink in prior L1 runs. Keep this
phase narrow.

Mandatory rules:

### Assigned verifier output checklist

{shard_checklist}

1. Do NOT spawn subagents from this verify shard. The current phase agent
   processes the assigned rows directly and writes one `verify_<ID>.md` file
   per row. Nested verifier swarms are forbidden because they multiplied prior
   L1 verification cost by O(number of findings).
2. Treat EACH row in `{manifest}` as the canonical
   finding card. Do NOT reread the full `findings_inventory.md` for every
   verifier.
3. Process rows sequentially in manifest order. The driver uses severity-aware
   shard targets: Critical/High ~8 rows, Medium ~12 rows, Low/Info ~18 rows.
   If a manifest exceeds 18 rows, verify all assigned rows but write a
   `violations.md` note so the driver shard budget can be increased before the
   next run. Keep a
   compact per-row scratch summary in memory and write the verifier file before
   moving to the next row.
   If the manifest has an `Expected Output File` column, write exactly that
   filename. Otherwise derive it as `verify_<Finding ID>.md`.
   On resume/retry, first check whether that exact verifier file already
   exists and contains `Severity:`, `Evidence Tag:`, and `Verdict:`. If it is
   complete, count it as done and skip to the next row. Do not rewrite
   completed verifier files just because an earlier run was interrupted.
4. For each row, read ONLY:
   - its own row in `{manifest}`
   - the exact source file(s) at the cited `Location`
   - the one `Primary Artifact` named in the queue row
   - one relevant `scip/*.md` helper or build artifact if the preferred tag
     requires it
5. Verifiers MUST NOT bulk-read unrelated `verify_*.md`, unrelated depth
   artifacts, or the entire scratchpad.
6. Model policy: every L1 verify shard uses the phase model, currently Sonnet.
   Do not request or spawn Opus, and do not spawn nested Sonnet subagents.
7. Every `verify_<ID>.md` MUST include these exact fields:
   - `Severity:`
   - `Preferred Tag:`
   - `Evidence Tag:`
   - `Verdict:`
   Missing any of these fields is a hard gate failure.
8. Verify ONLY the finding IDs present in `{manifest}`. Do not create
   verifier files for findings outside your assigned shard.
9. Before returning, run a final manifest checklist: every row in `{manifest}`
   must have its expected verifier file present and non-empty. If any file is
   missing, write it before returning. Never return partial completion such as
   1/2, 7/12, or 9/12 verifier files.
10. If the queued Location does not resolve, do NOT mark the finding
   FALSE_POSITIVE solely for that reason. First run a narrow location-recovery
   search using the finding title, source IDs, symbol names, and `scip/repo_map.md`.
   If a matching real location is found, update `Location:` and verify there.
   Only mark FALSE_POSITIVE after both the original and recovered locations fail.

(repo_map.md, call_graph_*.md, xref_map.md, panic_sites.md,

When spawning Task subagents for the 3 L1 depth roles
`depth-network-surface`, `depth-state-trace`, `depth-edge-case`,
`depth-external`:

1. Tell the subagent to **prefer SCIP queries over full-file Reads**

   ```
   To examine code: first try `Bash(python -m plamen_l1.scip_reader
   {{scratchpad}}/scip_rust.index find_references "SymbolName")` or
   `Bash(... definition "SymbolName")` -- these return targeted symbol
   data, not entire files. Fall back to Read on the source file ONLY
   if the SCIP slice is insufficient for the specific bug class you
   are analyzing.
   ```

2. **EXCEPTION for `depth-consensus-invariant`**: consensus bugs span
   many files and require cross-file reasoning that call-graph slicing
   cannot provide (documented in LLMxCPG Â§6). Tell this subagent
   specifically to use Read on consensus-related source files directly
   and NOT to rely solely on SCIP slicing. It may still consult SCIP
   flat files (`call_graph_consensus.md`, `xref_map.md`) but must
   verify via Read.

   0% recall loss on the protected agent.

## L1 BAKE EXECUTION CONTEXT POLICY (MANDATORY)

Bake is a deterministic tooling/pre-bake phase, not an agent orchestration
phase.

Rules:
1. Do NOT spawn Task subagents.
2. You MAY use shell/Python commands required by the L1 bake instructions.
3. Write or refresh `{expected_artifacts_list}` before returning.
4. Record unavailable SCIP/opengrep/ast-grep tooling in `primitive_status.md`
   and continue with fallback status instead of blocking on tools.
5. Do NOT proceed to recon, breadth, graph sweeps, inventory, depth,
   verification, or report.

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTION (execute BEFORE any tooling)

Your VERY FIRST action must be to write the file `{_scratchpad_str}/primitive_status.md`
with fallback content. This ensures the pipeline gate passes even if subsequent
tooling (scip-go, rust-analyzer, opengrep, ast-grep) fails or hangs.

Write this content immediately:
```
SCIP_GO_REUSED=false
SCIP_GO_AVAILABLE=false
SCIP_RUST_REUSED=false
SCIP_RUST_AVAILABLE=false
SCIP_PREBAKE_COMPLETE=false
SCIP_PREBAKE_FILES=0
OPENGREP_AVAILABLE=false
AST_GREP_AVAILABLE=false
```

Then attempt each tool. For each tool that SUCCEEDS, update the corresponding
line in `primitive_status.md` to `=true`. If a tool is not installed or errors,
leave its line as `=false` and move on. Do NOT block on any single tool.

## PORTABILITY: Do NOT use the GNU `timeout` command

`timeout` is GNU coreutils. It's on Linux by default but **absent on macOS**
unless the user ran `brew install coreutils` (which only provides `gtimeout`,
not `timeout`). Wrapping `rust-analyzer scip`, `scip-go`, or `opengrep` with
`timeout 120 ...` fails on macOS with `timeout: command not found`, which
makes the bake script wrongly mark the tool unavailable even when the binary
itself works perfectly. The downstream effect is silent SCIP/opengrep
degradation across every Mac install.

When you need to cap a single command, pick in priority order:

1. **Best — no per-command wrapper.** The Python driver already enforces a
   phase-level timeout that bounds the whole bake step. SCIP indexing on
   targets Plamen supports finishes well under that budget. Just run the
   command directly:
   ```
   rust-analyzer scip . --exclude-vendored-libraries
   ```
2. **Acceptable — wrap in Python.** `python3` is a Plamen prerequisite and
   guaranteed to be on PATH on every supported OS:
   ```
   python3 -c "import subprocess, sys; \
   sys.exit(subprocess.run(['rust-analyzer','scip','.','--exclude-vendored-libraries'], \
   timeout=120).returncode)"
   ```
3. **Last resort — detect coreutils.** If you genuinely need a shell timeout,
   prefer whichever of `timeout` or `gtimeout` is on PATH:
   ```
   TO=$(command -v timeout || command -v gtimeout || true)
   if [ -n "$TO" ]; then $TO 120 rust-analyzer scip ...; else rust-analyzer scip ...; fi
   ```

Never emit a bare `timeout N <cmd>` line into any shell script you write
during this phase.

   - Large generated artifacts from earlier phases, even if their filenames

   - Any file >= 5KB

3. **Task subagent prompts should include the paths of files the
   subagent needs to read** along with task instructions. Example:

   Task(..., prompt="Read {{scratchpad}}/attack_surface.md and
   {{scratchpad}}/state_variables.md. Focus on contracts X and Y.
   Analyze for [specific bug class]. Write findings to the assigned output

   context budget for that. You have a coordination budget.

   V1 prompt below says `python ~/.claude/hooks/phase_gate.py --init ...`
   or references `watchdog_state.json`, SKIP that step. The V2 driver has
   its own Python gate that runs outside your process. V1 watchdogs
   installed inside your subprocess will block later phases of the V2
   pipeline and must not be activated.

## RESUMPTION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY SECOND ACTION -- after reading config)

Before {resumption_action}, check the scratchpad for prior-attempt
work. A previous subprocess may have been interrupted and left partial
output -- do not repeat it.

1. List your expected outputs (the V1 prompt section for your assigned
   phase specifies them; check against `{{SCRATCHPAD}}` glob):
   Expected artifacts for phase `{phase_name}`: {expected_artifacts_list}
2. Any matching file >= 200 bytes is presumed COMPLETE work from a
   prior attempt. Do NOT re-spawn the subagent that would have
   produced it.
3. Only {resumption_missing_action} MISSING outputs or stubs < 200 bytes.
4. If ALL expected outputs already exist: skip straight to your
   phase's merge/analysis step (or exit if there is no merge step).
   Do NOT re-run agents whose work is on disk.

This protocol preserves 60-80% of prior work on interrupted phases and
prevents re-burning tokens. On a typical breadth retry: if 5 of 8
agents completed previously, you spawn only the missing 3.

## MCP POLICY

When an MCP tool call returns a timeout or fails, record `[MCP: TIMEOUT]`
and switch to fallback (code analysis, grep, WebSearch). Do NOT retry
the same MCP call. Claude Code's MCP timeout is 300s.

## READ-PATH DISCIPLINE (MANDATORY -- applies to coordinator AND every Task subagent)

Every filesystem-reading tool call (Bash directory listing, Glob, Grep,
Read, LS) MUST resolve to a path under either `PROJECT_ROOT` or
`SCRATCHPAD` as resolved in the CONFIGURATION block above. The audit
operates on exactly those two roots and nothing else.

Rules:

1. Always prefix paths and globs with `PROJECT_ROOT` or `SCRATCHPAD`.
   Bare patterns like `**/*.sol` or `*.md` resolve against the
   subprocess's working directory, which is NOT guaranteed to be the
   project root. Use `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/**/*.sol` instead.

2. Never read from paths outside these two roots. Examples of
   out-of-scope locations regardless of OS: system temp directories,
   the user home directory, OS package/cache directories, the global
   Claude config dir, anything reachable via `..` traversal from
   `PROJECT_ROOT`. If you are unsure whether a path is in scope,
   resolve it mentally against `PROJECT_ROOT` and `SCRATCHPAD` -- if it
   isn't a descendant of either, do not touch it.

3. Cap on tool-result size. If a Bash, Glob, Grep, or Read result
   exceeds ~200 KB or ~1000 entries, abandon that query, do NOT
   recurse, and switch to a narrower path-prefixed query. A runaway
   directory listing returns thousands of unrelated filenames and
   produces nothing useful.

4. Subagent inheritance. When spawning a Task subagent, the coordinator
   MUST include in the subagent prompt: "Read-path discipline applies:
   every Read/Bash/Glob/Grep MUST resolve under {{PROJECT_ROOT}} or
   {{SCRATCHPAD}}." Subagents inherit this rule.

Violation symptom: a single tool result containing thousands of
unrelated filenames (e.g., OS temp scratch files, system binaries,
unrelated repos under your home directory) is a violation. Abandon that
line of investigation, do not summarize the output, and proceed with a
narrower scope.
