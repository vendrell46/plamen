"""Contract tests for the invariant negative-case reachability directive.

Background: the DODO Crosschain Dex Thorough audit (May 2026) surfaced
two invariant-construction defects that no validator caught:
  1. `fuzz_nonEVMRefundClaimProtection` (Medusa) — the harness contract
     itself was a registered bot, so the authorization tautology meant
     the property mechanically could not return false. INV-003
     (Critical: anyone can steal non-EVM refunds) got a PASSED* sticker.
  2. `INV-9` (Foundry) — asserted "20-byte walletAddress claimRefund
     sends to stored wallet" while INV-8 simultaneously asserted "52-byte
     revertMessage triggers immediate transfer, never stored" — mutually
     exclusive properties. INV-9 "VIOLATED" because of its own setup,
     not the protocol.

Both share a root cause: the invariant-writing agent didn't prove that
its harness setup is capable of producing a failing test. The fix adds
a soft prompt directive (`STEP 1.5: Negative-Case Reachability`) to
both EVM invariant prompts requiring, for each invariant, a one-line
note describing the call sequence that WOULD falsify it.

This is intentionally PROMPT-ONLY — no post-phase validator gates the
output, because:
  - A hard validator that fails the depth phase on "missing negative
    case comment" would trigger a depth retry (we just fixed one of
    those in v2 commit 0299243). New retry paths are the exact thing
    the user asked not to introduce.
  - The directive's value is in the agent's THINKING during invariant
    construction; the comment is a forcing function, not the goal.

These tests lock in the prompt contract so the directive doesn't get
accidentally deleted in a future edit.
