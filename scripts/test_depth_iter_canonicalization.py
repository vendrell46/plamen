"""Regression tests for the depth iter2/iter3 filename-drift fix.

Background: the driver's depth manifest instructs the orchestrator to write
`depth_iter2_*_findings.md`, but in practice the LLM frequently drops the
`_findings` segment and writes `depth_iter2_state_trace.md` etc. Multiple
gates and parsers glob for the strict suffix and miss those files.

Live DODO audit (May 2026) burned an entire opus depth retry because of
this exact mismatch — same class as v2.3.4's perturbation_findings fix.

These tests lock in three guarantees:
  1. The tolerant glob in `_validate_confidence_iter2_mandatory` accepts
     both the canonical `depth_iter2_*_findings.md` form AND the de-facto
     `depth_iter2_*.md` form.
  2. The canonicalizer `_canonicalize_depth_iter_filenames` renames the
     non-canonical form to canonical so downstream strict-pattern
     consumers (inventory parsers, never-cut gate, prompt builders)
     also see them.
  3. The canonicalizer is idempotent and does not clobber existing
     canonical files.
