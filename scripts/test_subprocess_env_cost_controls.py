"""Tests for the Wave 1 token-cost controls in subprocess_env.

Background: research agent (token-cost-reduction round 1, May 2026)
identified three Anthropic-documented controls that reduce per-phase
token spend with zero or positive quality impact:

  1. BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH — caps Bash tool result size in characters,
     preventing stale tool output from inflating context on subsequent
     turns. Anthropic engineering blog "Writing tools for agents".
  2. MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS — same idea for MCP tool calls.
  3. ANTHROPIC_BETA="context-management-2025-06-27" — opt-in to
     automatic context editing where the model drops stale tool results
     from older turns. Anthropic-published benchmark: -84% tokens AND
     +29% performance on 100-turn workloads.

These tests verify the driver's subprocess_env composition includes all
three controls, applied with the correct scope:

  - Tool output caps: ALL phases get them (truly universal optimization)
  - Context editing beta: ONLY high-turn phases (depth + verify shards),
    to keep beta surface minimal until production data confirms broader
    rollout is safe.

The tests intentionally do NOT spawn real subprocesses — they exercise
the env-composition logic in isolation via a small surrogate harness.
The full integration is verified by live audit ledger comparison.
