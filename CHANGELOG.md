# Changelog

All notable changes to Plamen will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **V2 Resumable Pipeline**: Python driver (`plamen_driver.py`) runs one `claude -p` subprocess per phase with automatic checkpointing. Resumes from last successful phase on crash or usage exhaustion. Launched via `/plamen-wizard` or `plamen_driver.py`.
- **L1 Infrastructure Audit Mode**: `/plamen l1 [light|core|thorough]` for auditing blockchain node clients (consensus engines, p2p networking, mempool, RPC, validator lifecycle) in Go and Rust. 22+ injectable L1 skills, 2 new depth agents (`depth-consensus-invariant`, `depth-network-surface`), L1-specific severity matrix aligned with Immunefi v2.3, Phase 0.5 "Bake" (scip-go / rust-analyzer SCIP batch indexing), Opengrep cross-ecosystem static analysis.
- **Soroban/Stellar Chain Support**: 19 skills (13 cross-language + 6 Soroban-specific: auth_validation, storage_lifecycle, overflow_safety, contract_upgradeability, sep41_token_safety, custom_type_safety). Full pipeline coverage: recon, breadth, depth, verification, report.
- **OpenAI Codex CLI Backend**: V2 driver supports `codex exec` as alternative to `claude -p`. Tool translation, sandbox adaptation, path rewriting (`~/.claude/` → `~/.codex/plamen/`), model mapping. Codex config at `~/.codex/plamen/`.
- **Semantic Dedup Agent (Phase 4e)**: Pre-chain dedup pass with location-overlap, source-ID subset, PERT lineage, and same-fix-pattern merging signals.
- **PoC Execution Classifier**: Mechanical Python gates for coverage/integrity/demotion plus LLM Assertion Retry Protocol with harm-identity enforcement.
- **Report Assembly**: Deterministic Python-native report assembler replaces LLM-based concatenation (49ms vs 1+ hour on large reports).
- **Subprocess Isolation**: Plugin/hook/MCP isolation via `--settings` overlay prevents cold-start hangs from user plugins.
- **Phase Isolation**: Each V2 subprocess receives ONLY its own prompt section with forward-reference sanitization.
- **Pipeline Watchdog Hooks**: Claude Code Stop + PostToolUse hooks enforce artifact existence at phase transitions with two-strike stall model.
- **Confidence Scoring Model**: Scoring model upgraded haiku → sonnet for per-finding differentiation on large audits.
- **STABLESWAP_COMPLIANCE Niche Agent**: Curve/StableSwap fork compliance (Newton-Raphson convergence, A parameter encoding, reserve decimals).
- **Graph Artifact Pre-Computation**: Recon produces caller_map, callee_map, state_write_map, function_summary across all 5 SC languages.

### Changed
- **5 Smart Contract Chains**: EVM/Solidity, Solana/Anchor, Aptos Move, Sui Move, Soroban/Stellar (was 4)
- **Cross-platform path abstraction**: `plamen_home()` replaces all hardcoded `~/.claude` Python paths. Supports PLAMEN_HOME env, script-relative, and ~/.claude fallback.
- **Version normalized to v2.0.0**: All internal version references unified (was mixed v1.1.8 / v9.9.x / v2.2.0 A.x dev tags)
- **Light mode added**: 3 audit modes (Light/Core/Thorough) for Pro plan users (was 2: Core/Thorough)

### Fixed
- 200+ driver fixes across v2.0.0-v2.8.7 development cycle (see MEMORY.md pipeline entries for per-version details)
- Subprocess stdin pipe deadlock on all platforms
- MCP cold-start hang from plugin/hook interference
- Report assembly truncation on large reports (>25 findings)
- Gate-vs-gate collision between step-trace and coverage-fill agents
- False recon retry from determiner articles in placeholder detection

## [1.1.8] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Pipeline Watchdog Hooks**: Claude Code Stop + PostToolUse hooks (`phase_gate.py`) that mechanically enforce artifact existence at phase transitions. Prevents the orchestrator from skipping mandatory steps. Key features:
  - Two-strike stall model (warn then block)
  - Forward leak detection (blocks if later-phase artifacts appear before current phase completes)
  - Mode-aware conditional checking (perturbation/DST only in thorough, confidence scores only in core+thorough)
  - Niche agent enforcement (parses both bullet and table formats from template_recommendations.md)
  - Actionable recovery hints (block messages include specific agent types and template file references)
  - Anti-loop protection (block then free pass then fresh warn cycle)
  - Dormant for non-audit sessions (zero overhead)
  - Auto-installed via `plamen install` with platform-aware python resolution
- **hooks/ directory symlinked** by `plamen install` (auto-updates on `git pull`)
- **settings.json hooks merge** during `plamen install` (additive, platform-aware python command)
- **Step 0.9 watchdog init** in pipeline startup (activates enforcement before recon agents)

### Fixed
- **Perturbation and Skill Execution Checklist sections missing from 4 language trees**: EVM, Solana, Aptos, and Sui phase4b-loop.md files were missing the Finding Perturbation Agent and Depth Skill Execution Checklist sections that existed only in Soroban. The watchdog enforced these artifacts but the templates that agents follow to produce them were absent, breaking the completeness chain in Thorough mode. Now propagated to all 5 language trees with language-specific skill mappings.
- SETUP.md paste no longer triggers automatic RAG build (10GB RAM issue)
- RAG positioned as optional across all documentation with resource warnings
- Niche agent file naming aligned across SKILL.md, phase4b-required-artifacts.md, and watchdog
- Scanner artifact naming made flexible (accepts blind_spot_*, scanner_*, validation_sweep_*)
- Anti-loop stall state properly cleared after free pass
- settings.json.example hook nesting corrected (statusMessage/async inside hook entries)
- Python command resolution platform-agnostic (python3 on macOS/Linux, python on Windows)

## [1.1.6] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **MCP path resolution**: All MCP server commands (`slither-mcp`, `npx`, `python`) now resolve to absolute platform-correct paths during install — not just `python`/`python3`. Searches pip script directories (`~/Library/Python/X.Y/bin/`, `~/.local/bin/`, `%APPDATA%/Python/Scripts/`) via `sysconfig` when `shutil.which` fails.
- **Cross-platform migration**: Installer detects wrong-OS paths in existing `mcp.json` (e.g., `C:/` paths on macOS) and auto-fixes them to resolved local paths while preserving user env vars and API keys.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Pipeline Watchdog Hooks**: Stop + PostToolUse hooks (`phase_gate.py`) enforce artifact existence at phase transitions. Two-strike stall model, forward leak detection, mode-aware conditional checking. Dormant for non-audit sessions. Auto-installed via `plamen install`.
- **Perturbation Agent** (Thorough only): Post-depth agent that applies structured mutation operators (DIRECTION_FLIP, BOUNDARY_SHIFT, ACTOR_SWAP, ORDERING_REVERSE, AGGREGATION_SPLIT) to existing findings, testing adjacent vulnerability space. Targets single-hit satisfaction pattern where agents find one variant but miss symmetric counterparts.
- **Skill Execution Checklist** (Thorough only): Haiku agent that mechanically verifies depth agents executed all steps of their assigned skills. Execution gaps feed Devil's Advocate iteration 2 input.
- **Symmetric Operation Pairing** (Thorough only): Pre-computed pairs table (deposit/withdraw, borrow/repay, mint/burn, approve/revoke, pause/unpause) injected into depth prompts with mandatory both-sides coverage gate.
- **Static Artifact Manifest**: `phase4b-required-artifacts.md` per language tree — READ-ONLY manifest checked by orchestrator post-depth. Missing artifacts trigger agent spawns, not silent passes. Prevents orchestrator from skipping committed mechanisms.
- **Soroban Rule SB17**: Transaction resource budget exhaustion detection. Computes `max_reads = reserves_in_position × reads_per_reserve` and compares against Stellar's ~40 read ledger entry limit.
- **External data ordering check**: Sub-check added to `external-precondition-audit/SKILL.md` across all 5 language trees: "For each external data structure received: what ordering/uniqueness does the consuming code assume? Does the spec guarantee it?"

### Changed
- **Lending injectable sharpened**: Replaced 5 vague reasoning questions with mechanical grep-and-compare actions. Produces named output tags (NO_MINIMUM_POSITION, LIQUIDATION_RESOURCE_DOS, NO_UNPAUSE_GRACE, NO_FALLBACK_ORACLE). Net -4 lines.
- **MCP package management**: Pinned npm MCP server versions, added schema sanitizer proxy for unified-vuln-db, gated MCP install for legacy/existing configs only.

### Fixed
- 5 regressions in static artifact manifest (generic title, niche file names, EVM-specific fuzz artifacts, MODE gate, non-EVM fuzz requirement).
- MCP config now correctly targets `~/.claude/mcp.json` (not `~/.claude.json`).

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **NEW injectable skill: INTEGRATION_HAZARD_RESEARCH** — researches known footguns of external protocols the audited code integrates with. Solodit + Tavily queries per target, hardcoded hazard floor (30 protocols across EVM/Solana/Sui/Aptos), third-party race conditions, integration state TOCTOU. Triggered by `NAMED_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL` flag. All 4 chain recon prompts updated.
- **Oracle hardening (all chains)**: EVM oracle skill new Section 2d (pull-based checks — timestamp monotonicity, Pyth confidence intervals), Section 5c item 5 (chained feed deviation stacking), Section 1 (hardcoded stablecoin pricing). Sui/Aptos oracle skills: chained deviation + stablecoin check. Solana/EVM R16: new rows for timestamp monotonicity, confidence interval, chained feed deviation, hardcoded stablecoin price.
- **Calldata smuggling detection (EVM)**: storage-layout-safety new Step 4d — hardcoded offset into ABI-encoded data. 4 impact tiers (dual-read divergence, single-read assumption, revert injection, hash divergence). Covers calldataload, mload, byte-slicing, nested bytes. Memory vs calldata decoding asymmetry note.
- **Anchor IDL hidden instructions (Solana)**: account-validation skill IdlBuffer cosplay amplification note. Scanner C new CHECK 8b — 7 hidden IDL instructions, IDL authority claim, IdlCreateBuffer as cosplay primitive.
- **Silent misconfiguration (all chains)**: Scanner CHECK 2 extended with R14 bounds enforcement + silent misconfiguration sub-check (setter with no bounds that silently produces wrong math).
- **Immunefi Competitions RAG indexer**: new `immunefi_competitions.py` (984 lines) — 4th indexer alongside Solodit, DeFiHackLabs, Immunefi writeups. Indexes 879 competition-validated findings from 25 audit competitions. Windows-safe, 3 filename formats, 0.2s raw fetch delay. `plamen rag` now runs all 4 indexers. CLI: `--source immunefi-competitions`, `--competitions`, `--max-findings`, `--local-repo`.
- **Immunefi competition methodology analysis**: 14 agents analyzed 879 findings across 25 competitions — 0 methodology gaps found. Confirms pipeline coverage of all competition-validated vulnerability classes.

### Changed
- All new skills/checks follow v1.1.2 patterns (processing protocol, coverage assertions) where applicable.
- unified-vuln-db README rewritten — removed stale HuggingFace source, updated MCP tools table to 16 actual tools, corrected query examples and schema.
- Documentation updated across 13 files: 4k+ finding count, 8 injectable skills, 4 RAG sources.
- Raw content fetch delay reduced from 1.0s to 0.2s for raw.githubusercontent.com (no rate limit).

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **EVM recon: STORAGE_LAYOUT flag detection** — added grep pattern for `proxy|upgradeable|delegatecall|sstore|sload|assembly` and BINDING MANIFEST entry. STORAGE_LAYOUT_SAFETY skill was previously unreachable.
- **EVM recon: CROSS_CHAIN_MSG flag detection** — added grep pattern for `lzReceive|ccipReceive|receiveWormholeMessages|setPeer|setTrustedRemote` and BINDING MANIFEST entry. CROSS_CHAIN_MESSAGE_INTEGRITY skill was previously unreachable.
- **EVM recon: SPEC_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT niche agent** — added to niche agent binding rules and table. Was present in Solana/Aptos/Sui but missing from EVM.
- **EVM recon: ZERO_STATE_RETURN binding rule** — added `ERC4626 flag → ZERO_STATE_RETURN REQUIRED`. Flag was grepped but no binding rule enforced skill loading.
- **EVM/Solana recon: Injectable Skills section** — added full Injectable Skills section listing all 7 (EVM) / 6 (Solana) protocol-type-specific injectables. Previously missing entirely.
- **Aptos/Sui recon: Injectable Skills section** — expanded from VAULT_ACCOUNTING-only to full injectable list (6 injectables per language) plus ZERO_STATE_RETURN binding for vault protocols.
- **Uninstall crash** — `plamen uninstall` no longer crashes with KeyError if `settings.json` lacks a `permissions` key.
- **Stale doc references** — removed deprecated `solodit-scraper` and `defihacklabs-rag` from README, mcp-servers.md, dependencies.md, and repository-structure.md.

### Changed
- **Skill counts** — Aptos and Sui skill counts updated from 21 to 22 (21 standard + 1 core directive) in skill-index.md, internals.md, and repository-structure.md. Added MOVE_SAFETY_CORE_DIRECTIVES to skill-index.md.
- **Solana prompt count** — repository-structure.md corrected from 9 to 10 files (includes phase4b-invariant-fuzz.md).
- **Python version** — docs/setup.md corrected from "3.11+" to "3.11-3.12" (3.13+ has known issues).
- **Rust scope** — docs/dependencies.md corrected from "Required (All Platforms)" to "Solana only".
- **Audit modes table** — docs/audit-modes.md added missing "Orchestrator model" row.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **EVM Compilation Weight Check (Step 3c)**: Recon TASK 1 now counts `.sol` files and checks `via-ir`/`auto_detect_solc` settings before `forge build`. Heavy projects (>500 files, via-ir + >200 files, or multi-version pragmas) get `threads = 2` in foundry.toml and solc version pinning. Prevents parallel solc instances from exhausting system RAM and crashing Claude Code.
- **Solana Compilation Weight Check (Step 1e)**: Recon TASK 1 now counts `.rs` files and workspace members before `anchor build`/`cargo build-sbf`. Heavy projects (>300 files, >3 workspace members) get `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` prefix. Prevents parallel rustc instances from causing OOM.

### Why
Observed repeated crashes on large projects (e.g., Umia: 5,699 .sol files with `via-ir = true`). Foundry spawns 5-6 solc instances at 4-8GB each, exhausting RAM. Cargo does the same with rustc. Aptos/Sui Move compilers are single-threaded and lightweight — no mitigation needed.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Scanner CHECK 5 extension**: Untrusted call target validation — when code decodes an address from calldata and calls interface functions on it, the return values are untrusted unless the address is verified against a registry or factory. Fills a gap between "untrusted parameters in calls to known contracts" (existing) and "calls to untrusted contracts whose return values are trusted" (new). RC-METHOD fix from dHEDGE post-mortem (2 High misses).
- **Niche agent Processing Protocol**: All 8 niche agents now enforce enumerate-first processing — ENUMERATE targets → PROCESS exhaustively → COVERAGE GATE. Based on CheckEval (EMNLP 2025) and Plan-and-Act (ICML 2025) research showing binary per-item decomposition and plan/execute separation improve checklist adherence. ~100 extra tokens per agent, zero additional API calls. Applies to Core and Thorough modes.
- **Niche agent Coverage Assertion**: Pre-return reminder in all 8 niche agents requiring explicit verification that every enumerated item was processed. Based on Lost-in-the-Middle research — repeating key instructions at prompt end provides recency attention boost.
- **Niche Agent Coverage Judge (Thorough only)**: Post-iteration-1 haiku agent that mechanically cross-references niche output files against function_list.md to detect skipped entities. If gaps found, spawns targeted sonnet gap-fillers for missed items only. Added to all 4 language trees (EVM, Solana, Aptos, Sui).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **EVM CHECK 2g**: Missing native ETH receiver detection — flags payable functions/contracts that lack a `receive()` or `fallback()` function
- **DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS injectable skill**: Unit/dimension mismatch analysis for protocols using mixed fixed-point arithmetic (MIXED_DECIMALS flag)
- **Move-Safety Agent architecture (Aptos/Sui)**: New `move-safety-core-directives` skill split from the 4 always-required skills (~950 lines total). Core directives (~130 lines) load into every breadth agent; a dedicated Move-Safety Agent gets full skills. Prevents attention saturation on dense methodology.
- **Phase 5 batched verifier spawning**: When >8 verifiers needed, splits into severity-tier batches (A: Chain+High opus, B/C: Medium sonnet, D: Low+Info single agent). Crash-resume support — skips already-verified hypotheses on restart. Short return messages (~50 tokens/agent) prevent orchestrator context bloat.
- **New niche skills**: `callback-receiver-safety` (EVM callback handler access control, state inflation), `multi-step-operation-safety` (authorization conflicts, on-behalf-of targeting)
- **New injectable skill**: `lending-protocol-security` for lending protocol audits
- **Depth template improvements**: ANCHORING REJECTION LIST (7-row table of insufficient REFUTED/CONTESTED justifications), File Coverage Map task in inventory prompt, MIXED_DECIMALS flag in recon

### Fixed
- **`nice -n 10` on Unix**: Indexer processes now run at reduced CPU priority on macOS/Linux — keeps machine responsive during RAG build (~10-20% throughput cost on idle machine; none on loaded machine)
- **Adaptive RAG timeouts**: Fanless Macs (MacBook Air) get extended timeouts (1800s Solodit, 900s embedding) and reduced Solodit page count (5 vs 10) to prevent thermal-throttle timeouts
- **Resource warning banner**: `plamen rag` now warns before indexing: "RAG indexing is CPU and RAM intensive. Your machine may feel sluggish — do not close this terminal."
- **Status box RAG hint**: "not built" now shows "run 'plamen rag' (~10 min, CPU intensive)" hint
- **`sys.executable` MCP injection**: `_merge_mcp_json` replaces `"python"`/`"python3"` with `sys.executable` at install time — eliminates "spawn python ENOENT" on macOS/Linux without manual sed
- **Malformed JSON handling**: `_merge_settings_json` and `_merge_mcp_json` now show friendly errors (not raw tracebacks) when existing config files have trailing commas or syntax errors
- **Removed dead package installs**: `solodit-scraper` and `defihacklabs-rag` removed from `_setup_python_deps` — `unified-vuln-db` handles all RAG indexing internally; `defihacklabs-rag` had `openai>=1.0.0` as unnecessary hard dep
- **`plamen rag` dep-guard**: `_build_rag_db` auto-installs missing RAG deps before indexing — `plamen rag` is now self-healing after a fresh clone or partial install
- **Sentence-transformers quick-check**: `_setup_python_deps` quick-check now uses `import sentence_transformers, chromadb` instead of `import torch` — avoids 2-3s torch cold-start on every `plamen setup`
- **Pip `--user` args fix**: Corrected `[3:]` → `[4:]` slice bug that produced `--user --user` args
- **Always MiniLM embeddings**: Removed Nomic/Voyage model selection — always uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, ~90MB). Eliminates RAM crashes on 16GB M1 Macs.
- **`_python_bin()` space-quoting**: Uses `sys.executable` with double-quote wrapping for paths containing spaces

## [1.0.13] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **RAG separated from `plamen setup`**: The `setup` command no longer installs PyTorch (~2GB), chromadb, sentence-transformers, or builds the RAG database. These are now installed and built exclusively via `plamen rag`. This prevents 1+ hour install times and crashes on memory-constrained machines (M1 Macs with 16GB RAM, fanless MacBook Airs). Setup now completes in ~30 seconds.
- **New `_install_rag_deps()` function**: `plamen rag` auto-installs RAG Python dependencies before building the index. Users no longer need to manually pip install anything — just run `plamen rag` when ready.
- **Fixed `_RAG_MIN_ENTRIES` undefined**: Added missing constant (500) that would crash `check_dependencies()` at runtime.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **RAG indexing resource warning**: `_build_rag_db()` now prints a caution banner before indexing starts — warns that the process is CPU/RAM intensive, the machine may feel sluggish, and the terminal should not be closed.
- **`nice -n 10` on Unix indexer commands**: On macOS/Linux, all indexer subprocesses run at reduced CPU priority (`nice -n 10`), yielding CPU to other applications. No effect on indexing quality, ~10-20% slower on idle machines. Silently skipped on Windows.
- **First-time RAG hint in status box**: When RAG DB is not yet built (`-1`), the status box now shows `run 'plamen rag' (5-20 min, CPU intensive)` instead of bare `not built`, guiding new users.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **RAG build wipes wrong ChromaDB path**: `_build_rag_db()` wiped `custom-mcp/unified-vuln-db/data/chroma_db` instead of the actual database location `unified-vuln-db/data/chroma_db` (per `database.py` `parents[3]` resolution). The nuke was a silent no-op, leaving stale DBs from crashed builds untouched and causing rebuilds to fail with partial data.
- **Per-source RAG timeouts**: Replace flat 600s timeout with per-source limits — Solodit 1200s (20 min) / 1800s on fanless Macs (30 min), indexing 600s / 900s. Solodit retries removed (hanging API call doesn't improve on retry). Immunefi retry uses `--skip-fetch` to reuse cached HTTP responses instead of re-fetching 139 URLs.
- **`--skip-fetch` CLI flag**: Expose existing `skip_fetch` parameter in `index_immunefi()` as a `--skip-fetch` CLI flag in the indexer, enabling cache-only retry after a timeout without re-fetching all Immunefi URLs.
- **Solodit page count on constrained machines**: Reduce `--max-pages` from 10 to 5 on fanless Macs / low-RAM machines (29 tags × 10 pages × 3.5s delay exceeds timeout on slow networks).

## [1.0.10] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **RAG build hang on fanless Macs**: Stale ChromaDB with Nomic 768-dim HNSW index caused `get_or_create_collection()` to hang indefinitely when MiniLM 384-dim embeddings were used. Added `_wipe_if_dimension_mismatch()` to detect and clear dimension-mismatched databases before opening.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Thermal constraint auto-detection**: `_is_fanless_mac()` detects MacBook Air and other fanless Macs via IORegistry. `_should_use_fast_rag()` switches to MiniLM (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim, ~90MB) instead of Nomic Embed v1.5 (768-dim, ~500MB) on fanless Macs or machines with <16GB RAM, preventing thermal throttling during RAG indexing. Override with `VULN_DB_FAST_MODE=0/1`.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Cross-batch verification consistency check (Phase 5.2)**: Haiku agent checks for contradictions between verification batches before final report assembly.

### Fixed
- **Slither/Hardhat dependency failure**: Resolved installation conflict between slither-analyzer and hardhat dev dependencies.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Invariant generation bypass**: Agents could shortcut Phase 4b-invariant-fuzz template by summarizing properties inline rather than reading the full methodology file. Enforced agent-read requirement for fuzz templates (Rule 3 hardening).

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- **Non-destructive install**: Plamen now clones to `~/.plamen` instead of `~/.claude`, preserving existing Claude Code configuration. The installer creates symlinks into `~/.claude/` and merges configs additively (settings.json, mcp.json, CLAUDE.md with markers). Closes #3.
- **macOS/Linux support**: All commands use `python3` (not `python`). PATH setup targets `~/.zshrc` on macOS and `~/.bashrc` on Linux.
- **Windows support**: Clone to `$HOME\.plamen` (PowerShell). Directory junctions (no admin needed) for dirs, Developer Mode required for file symlinks. Documented in all setup guides.

### Added
- **Bootstrap auto-install**: `plamen.py` detects missing `rich`/`InquirerPy` on first run and installs them automatically before importing. No more `ModuleNotFoundError` on fresh installs.
- **`plamen rag` command**: Rebuild the RAG database without running full setup. Setup wizard now always shows RAG rebuild option even when database has entries.
- **`plamen help` / `plamen --help`**: Shows all available commands and options.
- **`plamen uninstall` confirmation**: Interactive prompt before removing symlinks and config entries.
- **`plamen` extensionless launcher**: Unix shells find `plamen` on PATH (previously only `plamen.sh` existed, which required typing the extension).
- **Install manifest**: `.plamen-manifest.json` tracks all installed symlinks for clean uninstall with `.pre-plamen` backup restoration.

### Fixed
- **einops missing from requirements**: `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` silently fell back to `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dims vs 768). Added `einops>=0.7.0` to unified-vuln-db requirements.
- **unified-vuln-db not globally importable**: `pip install -e` was missing, so `python3 -m unified_vuln.indexer` only worked from inside the package directory. Now installed as editable package during setup.
- **Solodit API key ordering**: Setup docs now set `SOLODIT_API_KEY` before running the installer, preventing silent Solodit indexing failure on first install.
- **3x `os.path.abspath` → `PLAMEN_HOME`**: Setup helper scripts (_solana_installer.py, _avm_installer.py, _sui_installer.py) failed when run through symlinks.
- **Solana skill count**: skill-index.md said 19, actual count is 20 (stale from v1.0.3 Trident addition).
- **"Info" vs "Informational"**: finding-output-format.md now matches report-template.md label.
- **CLAUDE.md marker guard**: Missing `<!-- PLAMEN:END -->` no longer crashes install/uninstall.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- **Skill file architecture**: All 92 skill files restructured from `SKILL_NAME.md` to `skill-name/SKILL.md` named-folder format with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Enables Claude Code skill registry compliance and reference file splitting for large skills.
- **Verification protocol split**: 4 large verification-protocol files (700-1097 lines) split into `SKILL.md` + `references/` subdirectory (advanced.md, templates.md) for better context management.
- **Orchestrator path resolution**: `commands/plamen.md` updated to construct `skill-name/SKILL.md` paths for standard skills, injectable skills, and niche agents (lines 467, 474, 724).
- **Em-dash normalization**: All em dashes (--) replaced with regular dashes (-) across modified files for consistent formatting.

### Fixed
- **Blocker from PR #1**: `commands/plamen.md` skill path references were not updated in the original PR -- would have caused silent skill loading failures. Fixed before merge.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Scope file estimation**: Parser now handles markdown tables (`| File.sol | 300 |`), bullet lists (`- contracts/File.sol`), and bare paths (`File.sol`) — previously only bare paths worked, causing "~0 lines, 0 files" for markdown-formatted scope files
- **Cost estimate consistency**: `/plamen` command now calls `plamen.py --estimate` instead of calculating inline — single source of truth, no more divergent numbers between wrapper and command
- **Double confirmation prompt**: Wrapper now passes `wrapper-launch` flag; `/plamen` skips Step 0d (cost estimate + confirmation) when launched from the wrapper since the user already confirmed

### Added
- `plamen.py --estimate` CLI flag: outputs JSON cost estimate for use by `/plamen` command

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Solana invariant fuzz campaign**: New `phase4b-invariant-fuzz.md` for Solana/Anchor — mirrors EVM v1.1.0 structure with protocol-derived invariants, finding-derived fuzz targets, lifecycle handlers, and 5 mandatory categories. Fills the EVM/Solana parity gap (was explicitly skipped in `phase4b-loop.md`)
- **Trident API reference**: New `TRIDENT_API_REFERENCE.md` (v0.12.0) — prevents method signature hallucination with correct CLI commands, types, and patterns
- **Lending/Liquidation injectable skill**: 247-line methodology covering health factor boundaries, interest accrual, liquidation mechanism safety, DoS vectors, bad debt socialization, collateral factor manipulation, asymmetric pause analysis
- **DEX/Slippage injectable skill**: 134-line methodology covering slippage parameters, deadline enforcement, return value handling, fee tier assumptions, router approval safety
- **Self-transfer accounting check**: Added to TOKEN_FLOW_TRACING in all 4 language trees — detects `sender == recipient` manipulating fees/rewards/snapshots
- **Timestamp unit confusion check**: Added to TEMPORAL_PARAMETER_STALENESS for Sui (`clock::timestamp_ms` vs seconds) and Aptos (`now_seconds` vs `now_microseconds`)
- **Denylist enforcement lag check**: Added to CROSS_CHAIN_TIMING for Sui and Aptos
- **Invariant quality self-check**: Tautological/sensitivity/testability filter before generating fuzz code
- **Scope selector**: Foundation/Integration/Temporal campaign scope based on protocol characteristics
- **Non-triviality guards**: Prevents false confidence from broken fuzz setups (0% success rate detection)
- **Platform dependencies guide**: New `docs/dependencies.md` with per-platform installation, troubleshooting, and Trident version compatibility matrix
- **Windows Developer Mode check**: `plamen.py` auto-detects and warns if Developer Mode is OFF (required for Solana symlinks)
- **OpenSSL auto-detection**: Fuzz templates inline-detect OpenSSL on Windows for Trident compilation
- **Cost estimation in `/plamen`**: Launch confirmation with codebase size, agent count, token estimate, API cost, and plan usage % with color-coded warnings

### Fixed
- **Trident v0.12 commands**: Replaced all `run-hfuzz`/`debug-hfuzz`/`HFUZZ_RUN_ARGS` references with v0.11+ commands (`trident fuzz run fuzz_0`). Trident v0.11+ uses TridentSVM — no honggfuzz/AFL required
- **Cross-platform Trident**: Documented and verified working on Windows (with Developer Mode + OpenSSL), macOS, and Linux
- **Recon probe**: No longer checks for `honggfuzz --version` — checks `trident --version` only

### Changed
- Solana skills: 19 → 20 (added TRIDENT_API_REFERENCE)
- Injectable skills: 5 → 7 (added LENDING_PROTOCOL_SECURITY, DEX_INTEGRATION_SECURITY)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-19

### Improved
- **EVM fuzzing**: Invariant fuzz and Medusa campaigns now derive invariants from `design_context.md` (protocol economics) and `findings_inventory.md` (bug targets), not just structural write-site analysis
- **No artificial caps**: Removed max 8/5 invariant limits and max 15 handler limit -- fuzz execution is zero token cost regardless of count
- **Lifecycle sequence handlers**: Mandatory multi-step handlers (create->repay->close) that construct realistic state random individual calls cannot reach
- **Realistic value bounds**: Handlers use protocol-actual decimals and parameter ranges from `constraint_variables.md`
- **Campaign config**: 256 runs x depth 25 (was 64x15), 5 mandatory invariant categories with coverage table in output
- **README restructured**: 865 lines -> 134 lines. Follows Ruff/Foundry landing page pattern
- **Documentation**: New `docs/` directory with 7 focused guides (setup, architecture, audit modes, MCP servers, usage, internals, repository structure)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Rule 12**: THOROUGH MODE COMPLETENESS -- mandatory checklist of 13 non-negotiable Thorough steps with violation logging
- **Rule 13**: NO SPEED OPTIMIZATION IN THOROUGH MODE -- blocks weasel phrases that skip steps
- **Pre-Depth checkpoint**: Assertions for invariant fuzz and Medusa campaign completion
- **Post-Depth checkpoint**: Assertions for confidence scores, adaptive loop log, manifest, iteration 2 enforcement
- **Phase 4b.5 inline**: RAG Validation Sweep explicitly marked MANDATORY for Core/Thorough
- **Skeptic-Judge enforcement**: Positive statement that Thorough HIGH/CRIT must run skeptic

### Fixed
- Design Stress Testing now unconditional (1 reserved slot, not budget-conditional)
- AUDIT MODES table updated to match Rule 12 (DST: "1 reserved slot, UNCONDITIONAL")
- `violations.md` and `checkpoint_postdepth.md` registered as scratchpad artifacts
- Removed internal planning document (`RAG_OVERHAUL_STATUS.md`) from public repo

### Changed
- GitHub repo topics added: web3-security, smart-contract-audit, claude-code, solidity, solana, aptos, sui, ai-agent, security-audit, ethereum

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Initial public release

Plamen is an autonomous Web3 security auditing agent for Claude Code. This is the first open-source release.

### Core Pipeline
- 8-phase audit pipeline: Recon → Instantiation → Breadth Analysis → Re-Scan → Inventory → Depth Loop → Chain Analysis → Verification → Report
- Two audit modes: **Core** (22-40 agents, HIGH/CRIT focus) and **Thorough** (32-90 agents, all severities)
- **Compare** mode for post-audit improvement against ground truth reports
- Adaptive depth loop with 4-axis confidence scoring and Devil's Advocate iteration
- Iterative chain analysis with enabler enumeration and postcondition-precondition matching
- Mandatory PoC execution with fuzz variants for Medium+ findings
- Tiered report generation (Opus for Critical+High, Sonnet for Medium, Sonnet for Low+Info)

### Language Support
- **EVM/Solidity** — 18 skills, Foundry/Hardhat build, Slither integration, fork testing
- **Solana/Anchor** — 19 skills, LiteSVM tests, Trident fuzzing, Helius on-chain data
- **Aptos Move** — 21 skills, Move test framework, resource/capability analysis
- **Sui Move** — 21 skills, test_scenario framework, object ownership analysis

### Skills System
- 79 language-specific skills across 4 trees
- 5 injectable skills (Vault Accounting, Account Abstraction, NFT Protocol, Governance, Outcome Determinism)
- 5 niche agents (Event Completeness, Semantic Gap Investigator, Spec Compliance, Signature Verification, Semantic Consistency)
- Flag-triggered loading to prevent context dilution

### Scanner Templates
- Blind Spot Scanner A: Tokens & Parameters (+ msg.value loops, returnbomb, gas griefing)
- Blind Spot Scanner B: Guards, Visibility & Inheritance + Override Safety
- Blind Spot Scanner C: Role Lifecycle, Capability Exposure & Reachability
- Validation Sweep Agent with write-completeness checks
- Design Stress Testing Agent (Thorough mode, budget redirect)

### Verification Protocol
- Pre-PoC feasibility gates (Reachability + Math Bounds)
- Evidence source tracking with mandatory audit tables
- Mock rejection rule (CONTESTED, not REFUTED, on mock evidence)
- RAG confidence override (historical precedent protection)
- Chain hypothesis protection with full-sequence PoC requirements
- Bidirectional role analysis for semi-trusted actor findings

### MCP Server Integration
- unified-vuln-db: RAG vulnerability database with Solodit API, DeFiHackLabs, Immunefi
- slither-mcp: Slither static analyzer (Trail of Bits)
- farofino-mcp: Solidity analysis fallback
- foundry-suite: Anvil fork testing, Forge scripts, Heimdall bytecode analysis
- evm-chain-data: On-chain contract ABI/state queries
- helius: Solana on-chain data
- tavily-search: Web search for fork ancestry and documentation

### Python Wrapper (plamen.py)
- Terminal UI with Rich + InquirerPy
- Mode selection, target detection, docs/scope/network configuration
- Auto-detection of project type (Foundry, Hardhat, Anchor, Move)
- Dependency checking, Ctrl+C handling, terminal width adaptation
- CLI fast path for scripted usage

### Security Rules
- 16 rules (R1-R16) covering adversarial assumptions, combinatorial impact, bidirectional roles, cached parameters, worst-state severity, unsolicited tokens, exhaustive enablers, anti-normalization, cross-variable invariants, flash loan preconditions, oracle integrity
- Finding output format with step execution tracking and depth evidence tags
- Severity matrix (Impact x Likelihood) with downgrade modifiers
