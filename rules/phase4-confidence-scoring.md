# Phase 4: Confidence Scoring & Adaptive Depth

> **Usage**: Orchestrator references this file during the Adaptive Depth Loop in Phase 4b.
> The scoring agent (haiku) uses the formulas below. The orchestrator uses the thresholds for routing.

---

## 4-Axis Confidence Model

Every finding is scored on 4 axes after Phase 4b iteration 1 completes:

| Axis | What It Measures | Scoring |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Evidence** | Quality of supporting evidence | Best evidence tag: [PROD-ONCHAIN]=1.0, [PROD-SOURCE]=0.9, [PROD-FORK]=0.9, [MEDUSA-PASS]=1.0, [CODE]=0.8, [DOC]=0.4, [MOCK]=0.2, [EXT-UNV]=0.1 |
| **Consensus** | Domain-aware agreement | (agents that flagged same root cause) / (agents whose domain covers this location). If only 1 agent's domain covers the location → Consensus = 1.0 if that agent found it. **Specialized agent bonus**: +0.2 when finding discovered by an agent instantiated from a Required skill template (capped at 1.0). |
| **Analysis Quality** | Depth of analytical work performed | **Mode A** (depth agent findings, including [DST-*]): Count Depth Evidence tags - 0 tags=0.1, 1 tag=0.4, 2 tags=0.7, 3+ tags=1.0. **Mode B** (all other findings): Legacy step execution - (steps marked ✓) / (total applicable steps). Steps marked ✗(valid reason) count as ✓. Steps marked ✗(no reason) or ? count as 0. |
| **RAG Match** | Historical precedent strength | RAG confidence from `rag_validation.md` (written by Phase 4b.5 RAG Sweep). Score = validate_hypothesis result / 10. If RAG Sweep tool call failed for a finding: 0.3 (floor). |

### Composite Score Formula

```
composite = Evidence × 0.25 + Consensus × 0.25 + Analysis_Quality × 0.3 + RAG_Match × 0.2
```

**Rationale**: Weighted average ensures no single axis can gate the score. Analysis Quality uses dual-mode scoring: depth agents are scored on concrete evidence tags (boundary substitution, parameter variation, trace to termination) to incentivize actual analytical work; breadth agents retain step execution scoring to avoid regression.

### Severity-Weighted Spawn Priority

Used by the orchestrator to allocate budget in iterations 2-3. Does NOT modify the composite score.

```
spawn_priority = (1 - composite) * severity_weight
```

| Severity | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | 4 |
| High | 3 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Low | 1 |
| Info | 0.5 |

Spawn highest-priority domains first within remaining budget. This ensures a Critical finding at 0.5 confidence (priority = 0.5 × 4 = 2.0) gets depth before a Low finding at 0.4 confidence (priority = 0.6 × 1 = 0.6).

---

## Routing Thresholds

| Composite Score | Classification | Action |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| ≥ 0.7 | **CONFIDENT** | No more depth needed for this finding |
| 0.4–0.7 | **UNCERTAIN** | Spawn targeted depth agent for this finding's domain |
| < 0.4 | **LOW CONFIDENCE** | Spawn depth agent + force production verification + RAG deep search |

---

## Convergence Criteria

1. **Hard iteration cap**: Maximum 3 iterations (iteration 1 = full coverage, iterations 2-3 = targeted)
2. **Dynamic spawn cap**: `depth_floor = 12 + max(0, 4 - actual_breadth_count)`, then:
   ```
   niche_injectable_count = len(niche_agents) + len(injectable_agents)
   niche_overflow = max(0, niche_injectable_count - 3)
   thorough_bonus = 5 if MODE == THOROUGH else 0
   hard_cap = 20 + niche_overflow + thorough_bonus
   // Raise the floor to guarantee iteration 2-3 budget:
   iter1_fixed = 10 + niche_injectable_count + 1  // 10 base + niche/injectable + DST
   iter23_reserve = 3 if MODE == THOROUGH else 0
   effective_floor = max(depth_floor, iter1_fixed + iter23_reserve)
   max_depth_spawns = min(max(effective_floor, ceil(total_findings / 5) + 7), hard_cap)
   ```
   The base cap (20) applies to Core/Light. In Thorough mode, the cap scales with niche+injectable demand AND the floor rises to guarantee iteration 2-3 budget. Base iter1 consumption: 10 fixed (4 depth + 3 scanners + 1 validation sweep + 1 sibling propagation + 1 DST) + niche + injectable. The `effective_floor` ensures max_depth_spawns is always >= iter1 consumption + 3 reserved slots in Thorough mode. Examples: Core, 4 breadth + 25 findings + 2 niche → floor=14, max=14, iter1=13, remaining=1. Thorough, 7 breadth + 68 findings + 11 niche/injectable → iter1_fixed=22, reserve=3, effective_floor=25, cap=33, max_depth_spawns=25, iter1=22, remaining=3.
3. **Progress check**: If NO finding's confidence improved in an iteration → exit loop early
3a. **Iteration 2 skip policy**: Iteration 2 may ONLY be skipped if all UNCERTAIN findings are Low/Info severity. If ANY uncertain finding is Medium or above, iteration 2 is MANDATORY. "Pragmatic" skips of iteration 2 for Medium+ findings are a workflow violation.
4. **Zero uncertain**: If 0 findings score < 0.7 after any iteration → exit loop
5. **Forced CONTESTED**: After all iterations, any finding still < 0.4 → forced to CONTESTED verdict
6. **Oscillation detection**: If >50% of score changes in iteration N are reversals (a finding that went up now goes down, or vice versa) → classify as OSCILLATORY → force all uncertain to CONTESTED, exit loop

## Anti-Dilution Rules

### Rule AD-1: Evidence-Only Carryover (+ Contrastive Path Summaries)

Between iterations, carry forward ONLY:
- Finding ID, title, location
- Evidence code references (file:line)
- Evidence source tags ([CODE], [PROD-ONCHAIN], etc.)
- Current confidence score
- A focused investigation question
- **Analysis path summary**: A 1-2 sentence description of WHAT the previous agent analyzed and HOW it reasoned - not what it concluded. Example: *"Iteration 1 agent traced the numerator manipulation path through supply changes; did not explore divisor staleness or timestamp anchor."* This summary is used for contrastive conditioning: telling the next agent what was already explored so it can deliberately diverge.

**Explicitly excluded**: All prior agent verdicts, confidence assessments, and cross-references. Analysis path summaries describe the EXPLORATION PATH (what was looked at), not the REASONING OUTPUT (what was concluded).

### Rule AD-2: Hard Devil's Advocate Role

Iteration 2+ agent prompts include a STRUCTURAL adversarial role, not just a soft freshness instruction. Research shows soft instructions ("think critically", "do fresh analysis") produce <50% divergence, while hard DA role assignment produces >99% divergence.

Iteration 2+ agents receive this framing:
*"You are the Devil's Advocate Depth Agent. Your PRIMARY job is to find what the previous analysis MISSED - not to re-confirm what it found. For each finding you investigate:*
*1. Read the analysis path summary (what was explored). Your job is to explore what was NOT.*
*2. For each CONFIRMED conclusion from iteration 1: ask 'what adjacent bug does this analysis OBSCURE?' What is the OPPOSITE interpretation of the same code?*
*3. For each REFUTED conclusion from iteration 1: ask 'what enabler makes this exploitable after all?'*
*4. You MUST explore at least one path that the previous analysis did NOT. If you find no new vulnerability after exploring that path, state what you explored and why it is safe — that is a valid output."*

**IMPORTANT**: Point 4 requires EXPLORATION, not PRODUCTION. A DA agent that explores a new path and concludes "this is safe because X" has done its job. A DA agent that fabricates a finding to satisfy a quota has not. The value of iteration 2 is the unexplored path coverage, not the finding count.

Iteration 2+ agents are told the analysis path (what was explored) but NOT the conclusions (what was decided). They receive analysis path summaries from AD-1 but no verdicts.

**MANDATORY**: The orchestrator MUST include the INVARIANT CONSISTENCY CHECK (HARD GATE) directive from the depth templates in every iteration 2+ agent prompt. DA agents are not exempt from the gate — they must check their findings against documented operational implications before CONFIRMING at Medium+. The orchestrator copies the directive from `phase4b-depth-templates.md` § INVARIANT CONSISTENCY CHECK into the DA agent prompt.

### Rule AD-3: Focused Input Cap

Each iteration 2+ agent receives at most **5 uncertain findings** in its domain. If more than 5 exist, prioritize by lowest confidence score.

### Rule AD-4: Fresh Tool Calls Mandatory

Iteration 2+ agents MUST make their own MCP tool calls (static analyzer, RAG) rather than relying on summaries from iteration 1. Fresh tool output prevents stale-data regression.

### Rule AD-5: New-Evidence-Only Re-Scoring

Re-scoring after iteration 2+ only upgrades confidence if the agent produced NEW evidence - defined as:
- A new code reference not in the iteration 1 output
- A new MCP tool output (static analyzer function source, RAG match)
- A new production verification result

Merely restating the same analysis with different words = zero confidence change.

### Rule AD-6: Error Trace Injection

Error traces from failed PoCs (Phase 5 verification) become investigation questions for post-verification targeted depth. Error traces bypass AD-2 (no reasoning contamination) because they are mechanical output from test execution, not agent reasoning. The orchestrator extracts error traces from `verify_*.md` files, writes them to `{SCRATCHPAD}/verification_error_traces.md`, and uses them as investigation questions for post-verification depth agents (only if budget remaining > 0).

## `extract_evidence_only()` - Finding Card Format for Iteration 2+

Each finding card sent to iteration 2+ agents contains ONLY:

```markdown
## Finding [XX-N]: Title
- **Location**: SourceFile:L45-L67
- **Evidence**: [CODE] - validation check at L45; [CODE] - state update at L52
- **Confidence**: 0.35
- **Evidence Gap**: [What specific evidence is missing - e.g., "No production verification of external behavior"]
- **Prior Path**: [1-2 sentence analysis path summary - what the previous agent explored and how. E.g., "Traced numerator manipulation via supply inflation; did not explore divisor staleness or timestamp anchor."]
- **Investigate**: [Focused question - e.g., "Can setMaxBond() be called with value below current totalBonded? Trace what happens to the while loop at L120."]
```

**Max ~250 chars per finding card** (excluding code refs). The Prior Path field enables contrastive conditioning without prescribing the approach.

---

## Re-Scoring Rules

1. **Monotonic confidence**: Confidence can only increase or stay flat between iterations. Evidence from prior iterations is preserved.
2. **New evidence required**: Score increase requires at least one NEW evidence tag not present in the previous iteration's scoring input.
3. **No self-referential scoring**: The scoring agent scores based on evidence artifacts in the scratchpad files, not on the depth agent's self-reported confidence.
4. **Scoring agent model**: Always haiku (mechanical task - formula application, not reasoning).

---

## Phase 4b.5: Mandatory RAG Validation Sweep

> **Trigger**: Always, after depth loop exits (Phase 4b DONE) and before confidence scoring.
> **Purpose**: Ensures every finding gets RAG validation as a PIPELINE STAGE, not an optional agent tool call.
> **Model**: sonnet (haiku rejects unified-vuln-db MCP tool schemas containing oneOf/allOf - see v1.0.1 fix)
> **Budget**: 1 agent (not counted against depth budget)

### Pre-check: RAG_TOOLS_AVAILABLE flag

Before spawning, the orchestrator reads `{SCRATCHPAD}/build_status.md` for `RAG_TOOLS_AVAILABLE`. This flag is set by the recon agent's unified-vuln-db probe (Phase 1).

- If `RAG_TOOLS_AVAILABLE = true` → spawn RAG sweep agent normally
- If `RAG_TOOLS_AVAILABLE = false` → spawn RAG sweep agent with **web search fallback mode** (see fallback chain below)
- If flag is missing (recon probe was skipped) → assume `true`, let the agent handle failures via its fallback chain

### Orchestrator spawns:

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", prompt="
You are the RAG Validation Sweep Agent.

## Your Task
For EVERY finding in {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:
1. Call validate_hypothesis(hypothesis='{finding title}: {1-line root cause}')
2. Call search_solodit_live(keywords='{vulnerability class}', max_results=10)
3. Record the result

If a tool call fails, record [RAG: TOOL_ERROR] for that finding - do NOT silently skip.

## Fallback Chain (if MCP tools fail)
If validate_hypothesis or search_solodit_live fails (API error, schema error, timeout):
1. Try get_similar_findings(pattern='{finding description}')
2. If that also fails: try get_common_vulnerabilities(category='{vulnerability class}')
3. If ALL MCP tools fail: use WebSearch fallback - search 'site:solodit.xyz {vulnerability class} {key term}' for each finding and extract match count + relevance
4. If WebSearch also fails: record [RAG: ALL_TOOLS_FAILED] and score = 0.3

**IMPORTANT**: If the FIRST MCP call fails with a schema/API error, assume ALL MCP calls will fail. Switch immediately to WebSearch fallback for remaining findings instead of retrying each one. This prevents N×timeout delays.

**IMPORTANT**: If MCP tools SUCCEED but return 0 supporting examples AND 0 solodit matches for the first 3 findings, treat this as 'empty database' and run WebSearch as a COMPLEMENT for all remaining findings (search '{vulnerability class} {protocol type} audit' and 'site:solodit.xyz {key term}'). MCP success with empty results is functionally equivalent to MCP failure for novel protocols.

## Output
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/rag_validation.md:
| Finding ID | validate_hypothesis Score | solodit_live Matches | Final RAG Score | Notes |

Return: 'DONE: {N} findings validated, {E} tool errors, fallback={MCP|WEB|NONE}'
")
```

### Retry on agent failure (orchestrator inline)

If the RAG sweep agent itself fails (API error, crash, 0 output):
1. **Do NOT retry with the same model** - the failure is likely schema-level, not transient
2. Log: `"RAG sweep failed: {error}. Writing floor scores."`
3. Write `{SCRATCHPAD}/rag_validation.md` with 0.3 floor for all findings
4. Continue to confidence scoring - the floor score preserves pipeline progress
```

The scoring agent reads `rag_validation.md` for Axis 4 instead of checking individual agent outputs.
