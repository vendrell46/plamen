# Phase 5: Mandatory PoC Execution

> **Core principle**: A PoC that is written but never executed provides ZERO mechanical evidence. Only executed tests produce ground truth.

---

## Evidence Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[POC-PASS]` | Compiled, executed, assertions PASSED - mechanical proof |
| `[POC-FAIL]` | Compiled, executed, assertions FAILED - attack does not work as described |
| `[CODE-TRACE]` | Manual trace with concrete values, no execution - fallible |
| `[MEDUSA-PASS]` | Medusa fuzzer found a counterexample - mechanical proof (same weight as `[POC-PASS]`) |

**Rules**: `[POC-PASS]` is the only tag that supports CONFIRMED as ground truth. `[POC-FAIL]` defaults to the attack not working - to override, demonstrate the failure is test setup error, not a defense. `[CODE-TRACE]` caps at CONTESTED unless the trace is complete with real constants.

---

## Impact Premise Verification (MANDATORY — HARD GATE)

Before writing the PoC, identify the finding's claimed HARM in one sentence — not the mechanism, but the consequence. The PoC MUST assert the HARM directly. A PoC that only proves a function can be called, a state can be reached, or a path exists is NOT a `[POC-PASS]` — it is a mechanism test, not a harm test.

**Examples of mechanism tests (INSUFFICIENT for [POC-PASS])**:
- "startLiquidation succeeds while market is active" — proves a function call, not user loss
- "parameter can be set to zero" — proves a setter works, not that the zero value causes harm
- "reentrancy callback is triggered" — proves a callback fires, not that state is corrupted

**Examples of harm tests (REQUIRED for [POC-PASS])**:
- "claimant receives 15% less than their pro-rata share after attack sequence"
- "user's withdrawal reverts permanently after parameter is set to zero"
- "attacker extracts 1.5x their fair share via reentrancy before guard triggers"

If you cannot construct a harm assertion, the finding is `[CODE-TRACE]` at best. If the harm assertion fails (user receives correct amounts, withdrawal succeeds, no excess extracted), the finding is `[POC-FAIL]`.

## PoC Testability Ledger (MANDATORY)

Every verifier output MUST include a structured PoC ledger before the evidence
tag is finalized:

```markdown
### PoC Attempt
- PoC Required: YES/NO
- PoC Class: <unit|property|integration|structural>
- Attempted: YES/NO
- PoC Not Attempted Because: <NO_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT|EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_NO_FORK_OR_ADDRESS|DEPLOYMENT_ONLY_REQUIRES_LIVE_EXTERNAL|PURE_SPEC_OR_DOCS_ONLY|STRUCTURAL_NO_EXECUTABLE_HARM_ASSERTION|N/A>
- Test File: <path or N/A>
- Command: <command or N/A>
```

For `unit` and `property` findings, a local executable attempt is mandatory
when a project build/test harness exists. `Compiled: N/A`, `Result: N/A`, "no
test written", and direct `[CODE-TRACE]` fallback are invalid unless the ledger
names a real environmental blocker. `STRUCTURAL_NO_EXECUTABLE_HARM_ASSERTION`
is not an allowed skip reason for `unit` or `property` rows; reclassify the row
or attempt the test.

Allowed no-execution reasons:

- `NO_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT`
- `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_NO_FORK_OR_ADDRESS`
- `DEPLOYMENT_ONLY_REQUIRES_LIVE_EXTERNAL`
- `PURE_SPEC_OR_DOCS_ONLY`
- `STRUCTURAL_NO_EXECUTABLE_HARM_ASSERTION` (structural/integration only)
- `CROSS_VM_ENCODING_NO_RUNTIME` — the bug is a wire-format / serialization
  incompatibility with another virtual machine or chain runtime (Solana / SVM,
  Bitcoin, Move / Aptos / Sui, Cosmos / IBC, native non-EVM chains) where the
  *harm* manifests only when the recipient runtime decodes the corrupt
  payload. A pure Foundry / Hardhat / cargo unit test cannot reproduce the
  recipient-side runtime, so an "executable harm assertion" against that
  runtime is impossible without a live cross-chain bridge environment.
  **Allowed only when ALL of these hold**:
  (a) The finding text mentions a target VM by name (Solana, SVM, Bitcoin,
      Move, Aptos, Sui, Cosmos, IBC, Wormhole, LayerZero, etc.) OR an
      encoding/serialization keyword (encoding, serialization, wire format,
      ABI, calldata layout, payload, message format).
  (b) The bug is a wire-format mismatch: incorrect field width, wrong byte
      order, missing length prefix, pointer-vs-inline layout, off-by-N
      offset, mload width mismatch, packed vs aligned ABI, etc.
  (c) The local-side state change IS verifiable in a unit test (the
      verifier MUST still demonstrate the local-side bug behavior — what
      cannot be reproduced is only the cross-VM side's decode failure).
  Document (a), (b), and (c) in the ledger's "PoC Not Attempted Because"
  rationale. Mis-using this reason to skip findings that COULD be
  PoC'd locally is a violation.

### Skip-Reason Validity Preconditions (MANDATORY)

A skip code is valid ONLY when its precondition genuinely holds. The driver
mechanically audits these (T2-a) and logs every violation to
`verifier_skip_audit.md`. Before citing any skip code, confirm:

- `NO_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT` — **INVALID if `build_status.md` reports a
  SUCCESSFUL build.** A successful build means the test harness exists:
  write and run the PoC. Use this code only when the project genuinely has
  no compilable build environment.
- `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_NO_FORK_OR_ADDRESS` — **INVALID as a blanket excuse
  when the dependency can be MOCKED.** A mock / stub of the external
  interface is a first-class PoC technique, not a fallback. If any other
  finding in this audit was proven with a `*Mock` / `*Stub` contract, then
  mocking is demonstrably feasible here — mock the dependency and run the
  PoC. Use this code only when the behavior genuinely requires live external
  state that cannot be mocked, stubbed, or forked.
- `DEPLOYMENT_ONLY_REQUIRES_LIVE_EXTERNAL` — **INVALID on a `unit`-class
  finding.** Unit-class findings are harness-testable by definition. If a
  finding genuinely requires live deployment, its PoC class is not `unit` —
  reclassify it rather than skipping a unit-class PoC.
- Empty / `N/A` skip reason — **INVALID on a `unit`- or `property`-class
  finding when a build harness exists.** `N/A` is not an environmental
  blocker. Attempt the test and record the real `[POC-PASS]`/`[POC-FAIL]`.

When in doubt, ATTEMPT the PoC. A genuine `[POC-FAIL]` is more valuable than
an unjustified skip — both are mechanical evidence, but only the attempt
tells you whether the finding is real.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Write** the PoC using templates from the language-specific prompt
2. **Compile** using the language-specific build command. On failure: read error, apply targeted fix, retry. Recovery ladder for common failures:
   - Missing import → add to remappings or install dependency
   - Type mismatch → check actual function signatures in source (anti-hallucination rule 3)
   - Constructor args → read deployment script or setUp() patterns from existing tests
   - Interface changes → re-read source file for current function signatures
   - Foundry version incompatibility → try `--via-ir` or pin solc version
   Max 5 attempts. After 5 failures → `[CODE-TRACE]` fallback, verdict CONTESTED
3. **Execute** using the language-specific test command. Record pass/fail/revert and paste relevant output
4. **Fuzz variant** (Medium+ only, Thorough mode): after the specific PoC, write a second test with the key parameters fuzzed (amounts, timing, ordering) and run it. Use the language-specific fuzz command. This explores the neighborhood around the finding mechanically - catching attack variants the agent didn't manually consider. If the specific PoC failed but the fuzz variant finds a violation, report the working variant.
5. **Record** in the verification file:

```markdown
### Execution Result
- **Compiled**: YES/NO (attempts: N)
- **Result**: PASS / FAIL / REVERT / NOT_EXECUTED
- **Fuzz variant** (Thorough only, Medium+): PASS (N runs) / VIOLATION_FOUND / SKIPPED / NOT_APPLICABLE
- **Output**: {test output - assertions, revert reasons}
- **Evidence Tag**: [POC-PASS] / [POC-FAIL] / [CODE-TRACE]
```

If execution was not attempted, explain why (no build environment, no test framework). Silent omission is not acceptable.

6. **Generate fix** (`[POC-PASS]` findings only): After a passing PoC confirms the bug, write a minimal diff-style fix. The verifier already has deep context from the PoC — this is incremental work, not a separate analysis task.

```markdown
### Suggested Fix
```diff
- vulnerable line(s)
+ fixed line(s)
```
**Fix scope**: {1-sentence description of what the fix does}
**Verified**: {YES — re-ran PoC with fix applied and it no longer triggers / NO — fix not mechanically verified}
```

   **Rules for fix generation**:
   - Only for `[POC-PASS]` findings. `[CODE-TRACE]` and `[POC-FAIL]` findings do NOT get fixes.
   - Keep fixes minimal — the smallest change that eliminates the vulnerability. Do not refactor surrounding code.
   - If the fix is non-trivial (architectural change, multi-file, or could introduce new issues): write `**Fix**: Architectural change required — {1-sentence description}. No inline diff provided.`
   - If time permits, re-run the PoC with the fix applied to verify it no longer triggers. Tag as `Verified: YES/NO`.
   - Tier writers paste the fix verbatim into the report — do not regenerate.

## Language-Specific Commands

| Language | Build | Test | Fuzz |
|----------|-------|------|------|

## Verification Completeness Assert (Orchestrator Inline)

After all verification batches complete, the orchestrator runs this mechanical check:

```
For mode=Thorough:
  verified_ids = set(all hypothesis IDs in verify_batch*.md files)
  required_ids = set(h.id for h in hypotheses)  // ALL severities including Low/Info
  unverified = required_ids - verified_ids
  ASSERT: len(unverified) == 0
  If FAIL: spawn additional verification batch for unverified hypotheses
  Log: "Verification coverage: {len(verified_ids)}/{len(required_ids)} total hypotheses"

For mode=Core:
  required_ids = set(h.id for h in hypotheses if h.severity >= MEDIUM) + chain_hypothesis_ids
  // Same assertion logic - Core now verifies ALL Medium+, skips fuzz variants only
```

---

## Assertion Retry Protocol (MANDATORY on assertion failure)

> **Purpose**: Distinguish "test setup was wrong" from "bug doesn't exist" with ONE retry.

When your test's assertion FAILS (the system behaves correctly, contradicting the finding):

**Step 1: Self-diagnosis (no code yet)**

Ask yourself:
- Did I test the EXACT function at the EXACT location from the finding?
- Did my setup create the EXACT preconditions described in the finding?
- Is my assertion testing the CLAIMED HARM, not just a mechanism step?
- Did I use realistic values from the codebase (not made-up constants)?

If ANY answer is "no" → Step 2A (fix setup). If ALL answers are "yes" → Step 2B (accept failure).

**Step 2A: Fix Setup (one retry)**

Rewrite ONLY the test setup/inputs. You MUST keep the SAME target function call, the SAME harm assertion, and the SAME finding location. Compile and run. If PASS → `[POC-PASS]`. If FAIL again → Step 2B.

**Step 2B: Accept failure**

Conclude `[POC-FAIL]`. Do NOT weaken the assertion to force a pass or change what harm you're testing.

**Anti-gaming rules:**
- Attempt 2 tests a DIFFERENT function than the Location field → `[CODE-TRACE]`, not `[POC-PASS]`
- Attempt 2 assertion checks different harm than Attempt 1 → `[CODE-TRACE]`

---

## Variant Exploration Before FALSE_POSITIVE

Before marking FALSE_POSITIVE, test at least ONE relaxed variant of the attack. Relax along whichever dimension caused the failure: timing (same-block → multi-block), amount (specific → range), ordering (A-then-B → B-then-A), or initial state (current → post-loss/post-pause/empty).

If the variant passes → report the working variant. After 2+ variant failures → FALSE_POSITIVE is justified.

## Non-EVM Fuzz Guidance

### Solana - Trident (preferred) or proptest (fallback)

**Trident** is a dedicated Solana fuzzing framework by Ackee Blockchain Security. v0.11+ uses built-in TridentSVM (no honggfuzz/AFL required - works on Linux, macOS, and Windows). Has found Critical bugs in Kamino, Marinade, and Wormhole.

**Detection**: Check `build_status.md` for `trident_available: true/false` (set by recon TASK 1).

**If Trident is available** (Anchor project + `trident-cli` installed):
```bash
# Initialize (if not already done - creates trident-tests/ scaffolding)
trident init
# Run fuzz target from trident-tests/ directory (v0.11+)
cd trident-tests && trident fuzz run fuzz_0
# Run with specific seed for reproducibility
trident fuzz run fuzz_0 12345
# Enable detailed logging
TRIDENT_LOG=1 trident fuzz run fuzz_0
```
Trident generates handler scaffolding from the program IDL. The verifier customizes the generated `fuzz_instructions.rs` to target the specific finding's instruction sequence, adds invariant checks, and runs the campaign. Violations are written to `.fuzz-artifacts/`.

**If Trident is NOT available** (native Solana program, or `trident-cli` not installed):
Use proptest as fallback:
```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_fuzz_hypothesis(amount in 1u64..1_000_000_000u64, delay in 0u64..86400u64) {
        // setup, execute, assert invariant
    }
}
```
If proptest is also not available, fall back to boundary-value parameterized tests (3-5 concrete values covering min, typical, max).

### Soroban - cargo-fuzz (preferred) or proptest (fallback)

**cargo-fuzz** is the standard Rust fuzzing tool using libFuzzer. Requires nightly Rust. Soroban contracts need `crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]` in Cargo.toml for fuzz crate linking.

**Detection**: Check `build_status.md` for `cargo_fuzz_available: true/false` (set by recon TASK 1 — tests `cargo +nightly fuzz --version`).

**If cargo-fuzz is available** (nightly Rust installed):
```bash
# Initialize (if not already done - creates fuzz/ directory)
cargo fuzz init
# Run fuzz target
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1
# Run with timeout
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1 -- -max_total_time=300
```
The verifier writes a fuzz harness using `soroban-sdk` testutils with `Env::default()`, registers the contract, and fuzzes the key parameters. Use `#[derive(Arbitrary)]` or `SorobanArbitrary` for input generation. NEVER use `panic!()` in fuzzable code — use `panic_with_error!` or return errors.

**If cargo-fuzz is NOT available** (no nightly, or Windows issues):
Use proptest as fallback (works on stable Rust, all platforms):
```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;
use proptest_arbitrary_interop::arb;
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_fuzz_hypothesis(amount in 1i128..1_000_000_000i128, timestamp in 0u64..86400u64) {
        let env = Env::default();
        // setup, execute, assert invariant
    }
}
```
If proptest is also not available, fall back to boundary-value parameterized tests (3-5 concrete values covering 0, 1, typical, i128::MAX).

### Aptos - parameterized boundary tests
Aptos Move lacks a built-in random-input fuzzer. Write multiple `#[test]`
functions with concrete boundary values:
```move
#[test] fun test_hypothesis_min() { run_test(0, 1); }
#[test] fun test_hypothesis_mid() { run_test(500_000, 86400); }
#[test] fun test_hypothesis_max() { run_test(MAX_U64, MAX_U64); }
```
This provides 3+ data points instead of 1, catching boundary-dependent bugs without a full fuzzer.

### Sui - random-input tests with boundary fallback
Prefer Sui Move random-input tests for fuzz variants:

```move
#[random_test]
fun test_hypothesis_random(input: u64) {
    run_test(input);
}
```

Run with `sui move test --rand-num-iters 100 test_hypothesis_random`. If the
random-input test cannot compile for the target harness, fall back to the
boundary-value parameterized test pattern above and document the limitation.
