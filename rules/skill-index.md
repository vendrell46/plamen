# Skill Index

> Skills are methodology files read by agents via `Read ~/.claude/agents/skills/{LANGUAGE}/{name}/SKILL.md`.
> The orchestrator resolves `{LANGUAGE}` to `evm`, `solana`, `aptos`, or `sui` based on Step 0 detection.
> EVM has 18 skills, Solana has 20 skills, Aptos has 21 skills, Sui has 21 skills - no shared skills directory exists.

## EVM Skills (`~/.claude/agents/skills/evm/`)

> Load these when `LANGUAGE=evm`. All 18 skills use EVM/Solidity concepts.

## Injectable Skills (`~/.claude/agents/skills/injectable/`)

> Injectable skills are protocol-type-specific. They load ONLY when recon classifies the protocol as the matching type.
> They are NOT counted in the per-tree standard skill set.
> They merge into existing agents via the standard merge hierarchy - they do NOT spawn new agents.

| Skill | Protocol Type Trigger | Inject Into |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS | `MIXED_DECIMALS` flag (mulDiv/mulWad/rayMul + 1e6/1e8/decimals() in scope) | depth-token-flow, depth-state-trace |
| VAULT_ACCOUNTING | `vault` | Core state or economic design agent (M4) |
| ACCOUNT_ABSTRACTION_SECURITY | `account_abstraction` (ERC-4337, EntryPoint, UserOperation, Paymaster) | Breadth agents, depth-external |
| NFT_PROTOCOL_SECURITY | `nft` (ERC721/ERC1155 with marketplace, staking, or collateral logic) | Breadth agents, depth-token-flow, depth-edge-case |
| GOVERNANCE_ATTACK_VECTORS | `governance` (Governor, Timelock, voting, proposal, quorum, delegate) | Breadth agents, depth-external, depth-edge-case |
| OUTCOME_DETERMINISM | `outcome_determinism` (finite-pool selection with depletion fallback + time-gated actions with observable default/fallback outcomes). NOTE: callback selective revert and RNG consumption enumeration are now ALWAYS-ON in depth templates, not in this injectable. | Breadth agents, depth-edge-case |
| LENDING_PROTOCOL_SECURITY | `lending` (liquidate/borrow/repay/collateral/lend/loan/LTV/healthFactor/interestRate/debtToken) | Breadth agents, depth-token-flow, depth-edge-case, depth-state-trace |
| DEX_INTEGRATION_SECURITY | `dex_integration` (swap/addLiquidity/removeLiquidity/IUniswapV2Router/ISwapRouter/amountOutMin - AND protocol is NOT itself a DEX) | Breadth agents, depth-external, depth-edge-case |

### How Injectable Skills Work
1. Recon Agent classifies protocol type in TASK 0 Step 1
2. Recon Agent adds injectable skill recommendations to `template_recommendations.md` under `## Injectable Skills`
3. Orchestrator reads injectable recommendations during Phase 2 instantiation
4. Injectable skill methodology is APPENDED to the relevant agent's prompt (not a separate agent)
5. No new agents spawned - injectable skills increase depth of existing agents

## Niche Agents (`~/.claude/agents/skills/niche/`)

> Niche agents are flag-triggered STANDALONE agents. Unlike injectable skills (which append methodology to existing agents), niche agents spawn as independent agents in Phase 4b iteration 1. Each costs 1 depth budget slot.
> They are NOT counted in the per-tree standard skill set.
> Use niche agents instead of bloating scanner templates when a concern area needs focused depth.

| Niche Agent | Trigger Flag | Budget | Description |
|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| EVENT_COMPLETENESS | `MISSING_EVENT` | 1 slot | Event emission coverage, parameter accuracy, cross-component event gaps |
| SEMANTIC_GAP_INVESTIGATOR | `sync_gaps >= 1` OR `accumulation_exposures >= 1` OR `conditional_writes >= 1` OR `cluster_gaps >= 1` (from Phase 4a.5) | 1 slot | Investigates SYNC_GAP, ACCUMULATION_EXPOSURE, CONDITIONAL, and CLUSTER_GAP flags from semantic invariants to conclusion |
| SPEC_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT | `HAS_DOCS` flag (non-empty DOCS_PATH with testable claims) | 1 slot | Spec-to-code compliance: extracts doc claims, verifies against code, reports mismatches |
| SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_AUDIT | `HAS_SIGNATURES` flag (ecrecover/ECDSA.recover/permit/EIP712/domainSeparator/nonces/isValidSignature) | 1 slot | Signature replay, malleability, EIP-712 domain, permit front-run, nonce management, cross-chain replay |
| SEMANTIC_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT | `HAS_MULTI_CONTRACT` flag (2+ in-scope contracts sharing parameters or formulas) | 1 slot | Config variable unit mismatches, formula semantic drift, magic number consistency across contracts |
| MULTI_STEP_OPERATION_SAFETY | `MULTI_STEP_OPS` flag (approve/delegate/authorize patterns + on-behalf-of functions: depositFor/stakeFor/delegateTo/mintFor/withdrawFor) | 1 slot | Authorization sequence conflicts in batch/multi-step operations, infrastructure address targeting via public on-behalf-of functions |
| CALLBACK_RECEIVER_SAFETY | `OUTCOME_CALLBACK` flag (onERC721Received/onERC1155Received/tokensReceived/onTransferReceived/onFlashLoan/executeOperation/receive()/fallback()) | 1 slot | (EVM only) Callback handler access control, permissionless state inflation via callbacks, selective revert exploitation |

### How Niche Agents Work
1. Recon Agent 3 detects trigger flag (e.g., `MISSING_EVENT` from setter_list.md/emit_list.md)
2. Recon adds niche agent to `template_recommendations.md` → `## Niche Agents` in BINDING MANIFEST
3. Orchestrator reads niche agent definition from `~/.claude/agents/skills/niche/{name}/SKILL.md`
4. Orchestrator spawns niche agent in Phase 4b iteration 1 alongside standard depth agents
5. Niche agent writes to `{SCRATCHPAD}/niche_{name}_findings.md`
6. Chain analysis reads niche agent output alongside depth/scanner findings

### When to Use Niche Agents vs Injectable Skills vs Scanner Sub-Checks
| Criteria | Scanner Sub-Check | Injectable Skill | Niche Agent |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Lines of methodology | ≤5 | 10-100 | 50-150 |
| Applies universally? | Yes | No (protocol-type) | No (flag-triggered) |
| Spawns new agent? | No | No | **Yes** (1 budget slot) |
| Depth of analysis | Surface scan | Medium (enriches existing agent) | **Deep** (entire agent focused on one concern) |
| Use when | Quick check, low FP risk | Protocol-type-specific methodology | Concern needs dedicated focus, scanner sub-check is insufficient |
