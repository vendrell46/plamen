# Phase 6: Report Generation Prompt Templates

> **Usage**: Orchestrator reads this file and spawns the report pipeline: Index → 3 Tier Writers → Assembler.
> Replace placeholders `{SCRATCHPAD}`, `{PROJECT_ROOT}`, `{PASTE_VERDICTS}`, etc. with actual values.

> **Architecture**: Index Agent → 3 Parallel Tier Writers → Assembler Agent
> **Why**: A single report agent gets overwhelmed on 30+ hypotheses, producing catch-all tables and invisible findings. Splitting by severity tier ensures every finding gets a proper write-up.

---

## Step 6a: Index Agent

> **Model**: haiku (mechanical task - fast, cheap)
> **Purpose**: Creates master index mapping internal hypothesis IDs to clean report IDs. Assigns each hypothesis to exactly one tier.

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku", prompt="
You are the Report Index Agent. You create the master finding index for the audit report.

## Your Inputs
Read:
- {SCRATCHPAD}/hypotheses.md (all grouped hypotheses with final severities)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/chain_hypotheses.md (chain hypotheses with severity upgrades)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/finding_mapping.md (hypothesis → agent finding mapping)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/contract_inventory.md (component list for report header)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md (complete agent finding inventory)

Verification verdicts from orchestrator:
{PASTE_VERDICTS}

## Your Task

### STEP 1: Determine Final Severities

For each hypothesis, apply this priority order:
1. If a verifier returned a verdict → use verifier's final severity
2. If chain analysis upgraded severity → use upgraded severity
3. Otherwise → use the severity from hypotheses.md
4. **Apply trust assumption downgrades**: Check {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md for `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: TRUSTED-ACTOR]` tags. For tagged findings, apply −1 tier severity downgrade (floor: Informational). Note the original severity and downgrade reason in the Master Finding Index under a "Trust Adj." column. For `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: WITHIN-BOUNDS]` tags: do NOT change severity, but note the flag in the index for tier writers to include as context. **Mechanical enforcement**: The Index Agent MUST NOT override, remove, or selectively skip Inventory Agent tags. If a finding has the `TRUSTED-ACTOR` tag, apply the downgrade. If it does not have the tag, do not downgrade. No exceptions for chain upgrades, verification results, or analytical reasoning - the Inventory Agent is the sole authority on trust tagging.
5. **Proven-only demotion** (if `PROVEN_ONLY = true`): For each finding whose BEST evidence tag is `[CODE-TRACE]` (no `[POC-PASS]`, `[MEDUSA-PASS]`, `[PROD-ONCHAIN]`, `[PROD-SOURCE]`, or `[PROD-FORK]`), cap severity at Low. Record the original severity in the "Trust Adj." column as `PROVEN(original_sev)`. Count total demotions for the report header note: *"Proven-only mode enabled: {N} findings capped at Low from {severities} due to unproven evidence ([CODE-TRACE] only)."*

### STEP 1.5: Root-Cause Consolidation (MANDATORY)

Before assigning report IDs, consolidate hypotheses that share the same root cause into single report findings. This prevents inflated finding counts from pipeline fragmentation.

**Consolidation test** - merge two hypotheses into ONE report finding if ALL of these are true:
1. **Same fix pattern**: Both require the same TYPE of code change (e.g., both need "add zero-value validation to admin setter", both need "emit event on state change")
2. **Same severity tier**: Both are in the same tier after STEP 1 adjustments
3. **Same vulnerability class**: Both are instances of the same bug pattern (e.g., "missing event", "missing input validation", "no staleness check")
4. **Describable together**: A reader can understand all affected locations from a single description + location table

**Do NOT merge if**:
- Findings are in different severity tiers (a Medium and a Low stay separate even if same class)
- The root causes are genuinely different (e.g., "missing event" vs "wrong event parameters" - different fixes)
- Merging would exceed 6 locations per finding (split into 2 findings for readability)

**Common consolidation patterns**:
| Pattern | Example Hypotheses | Consolidated Title |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Missing events on state changes | "setX no event" + "setY no event" + "setZ no event" | "Missing event emission on admin state changes" |
| Admin setters accept zero/invalid | "paramA accepts zero" + "paramB accepts zero" | "Admin setters lack zero-value validation" |
| Missing staleness checks | "no staleness on X" + "no max staleness on Y" | "Rate provider staleness not validated" |
| Retroactive parameter changes | "paramA retroactive" + "paramB retroactive" | "Global parameter changes retroactively affect pending state" |
| Same-role trust findings | "ROLE can do X" + "ROLE can do Y" (same role, same trust level) | "ROLE capabilities exceed stated trust level" |

**Output**: For each consolidation, record:
```
CONSOLIDATED: H-{A} + H-{B} [+ H-{C}...] → single finding
  Title: {consolidated title}
  Locations: {list all affected locations}
  Severity: {shared severity}
  Internal refs: {all absorbed hypothesis IDs}
```

Hypotheses NOT consolidated remain as standalone findings.

### STEP 2: Assign Report IDs

Sort all findings (consolidated and standalone) by severity tier, then by verification status (VERIFIED first), then by impact.

Assign clean sequential IDs:
- Critical: C-01, C-02, ...
- High: H-01, H-02, ...
- Medium: M-01, M-02, ...
- Low: L-01, L-02, ...
- Informational: I-01, I-02, ...

### STEP 3: Create Tier Assignments

Assign each finding to exactly ONE tier writer:
- **Critical+High Tier**: All C-XX and H-XX findings
- **Medium Tier**: All M-XX findings
- **Low+Info Tier**: All L-XX and I-XX findings

### STEP 4: Create Cross-Reference Map

For chain findings that reference component findings, note the cross-references using REPORT IDs only.
Example: If chain hypothesis CH-1 (now C-01) references standalone hypothesis H-5 (now H-03), record: 'C-01 references H-03'

### STEP 5: Verify Completeness (MANDATORY)

Cross-check: For EVERY hypothesis in hypotheses.md AND every standalone finding
([VS-*], [BLIND-*], [SE-*], [EN-*], [SLITHER-*]) in findings_inventory.md:
- Is it assigned a report ID in the Master Finding Index above?
- If NO and NOT marked FALSE_POSITIVE by a verifier → ASSIGN a report ID and tier

**HARD RULE**: The ONLY valid exclusion reason is an explicit FALSE_POSITIVE verdict
from a Phase 5 verifier OR an explicit duplicate already listed (cite the absorbing
report ID). "Not grouped into a hypothesis" is NOT a valid exclusion reason.

### Excluded Findings (for Appendix A)
| Internal ID | Severity | Title | Exclusion Reason (FALSE_POSITIVE or DUPLICATE OF X-NN only) |

## Output

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md:

```markdown
# Report Index

## Report Header Info
- Project Name: {from design_context.md}
- Date: {today}
- Contracts: {from contract_inventory.md}
- Build Status: {from build_status.md}

## Summary Counts
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | {N} |
| High | {N} |
| Medium | {N} |
| Low | {N} |
| Informational | {N} |

## Master Finding Index

| Report ID | Title | Severity | Location | Verification | Trust Adj. | Internal Hypothesis | Agent Sources |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| C-01 | [title] | Critical | [location] | VERIFIED | - | [internal ref] | [agents] |
| H-01 | [title] | High | [location] | VERIFIED | - | [internal ref] | [agents] |
| M-01 | [title] | Medium↓H | [location] | UNVERIFIED | TRUSTED-ACTOR | [internal ref] | [agents] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Tier Assignments

### Critical+High Tier (for Opus writer)
[List of report IDs with their internal hypothesis refs and verification file paths]

### Medium Tier (for Sonnet writer)
[List of report IDs with their internal hypothesis refs]

### Low+Info Tier (for Sonnet writer)
[List of report IDs with their internal hypothesis refs]

## Consolidation Map
| Report ID | Consolidated From | Consolidation Reason |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| L-03 | H-39, H-40, H-55 | Same fix pattern: add zero-value validation to admin setters |
| L-08 | H-70, H-71 | Same fix pattern: add event emission to admin state changes |

## Cross-Reference Map
| Report ID | References | Context |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| C-01 | H-03, M-05 | Chain: C-01 combines the bugs described in H-03 and M-05 |

## Excluded Findings (for Appendix A)
| Internal ID | Severity | Title | Exclusion Reason (FALSE_POSITIVE or DUPLICATE OF X-NN only) |
```

Return: 'DONE: {N_total} findings indexed ({N_consolidated} consolidated from {N_original} hypotheses) - {C} Critical, {H} High, {M} Medium, {L} Low, {I} Info'
")
```

### Step 6a.1: Completeness Verification (Orchestrator Inline)

After Index Agent returns, orchestrator performs:
1. Count hypothesis IDs in `{SCRATCHPAD}/hypotheses.md` (grep for `| H-`)
2. Count report IDs in `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md` Master Finding Index
3. Count excluded IDs in `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md` Excluded Findings
4. Count consolidated IDs (hypotheses absorbed into another report finding via STEP 1.5)
5. **ASSERT**: `hypothesis_count == report_ids + excluded_count + consolidated_absorbed_count`
6. If **MISMATCH**:
   - Diff ID sets to find missing hypotheses
   - Log: `"INDEX COMPLETENESS FAILURE: {missing_list}"`
   - Re-spawn Index Agent with: `"Assign report IDs to these missing hypotheses: {list}"`
   - Re-run this verification after re-spawn

> **This is a mechanical check - the orchestrator does it inline, no new agent needed.**

---

## Step 6b: Tier Writers (3 Parallel Agents)

> **Spawn ALL THREE in a single message as parallel Task calls.**
> Each tier writer receives ONLY its assigned findings from report_index.md.

### Tier Writer Common Rules (referenced by all 3 writers)

All tier writers MUST follow these rules:
1. **NO internal IDs** (hypothesis IDs, chain IDs, agent IDs) anywhere in output
2. **Every finding gets its own ### section** - no tables, no groups, no summaries, no catch-all dumps
3. **Write as if the reader has never seen the audit pipeline** - no references to breadth agents, chain analysis, etc.
4. **Cross-references use report IDs only** - include finding title in parentheses for context: `see H-03 (example title)`
5. **Trust assumption context**: If report_index.md marks a finding with `TRUSTED-ACTOR` in the Trust Adj. column, include after Severity: *"Severity adjusted from {original} - attack requires {actor} to violate stated trust assumption: {assumption}."* For `WITHIN-BOUNDS` flags: include a note in Description that the impact falls within the protocol's stated operational bounds for the semi-trusted actor. Do NOT change the severity for WITHIN-BOUNDS - flag only.

### Critical+High Tier Writer

> **Model**: opus (highest quality for most important findings)

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus", prompt="
You are the Critical+High Findings Writer. You write the Critical and High severity sections of the audit report.

## Your Inputs
Read:
- {SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md (your tier assignments under 'Critical+High Tier')
- {SCRATCHPAD}/hypotheses.md (detailed hypothesis descriptions)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/chain_hypotheses.md (chain attack sequences)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/verify_*.md (verification results with PoC details)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/synthesis_full.md (full analysis context)
- ~/.claude/rules/report-template.md (finding format and rules)

## Your Task

For EACH finding assigned to your tier in report_index.md:

1. Write a full finding section using the EXACT format from report-template.md
2. Use the report ID from report_index.md (C-01, H-01, etc.) - NEVER use internal pipeline IDs
3. Include code snippets from the actual source files

5. For verified findings: include PoC results from verify_*.md
6. Cross-reference other findings using ONLY report IDs from report_index.md

## HARD RULES
Follow ALL Tier Writer Common Rules above (no internal IDs, own ### per finding, reader-naive perspective, report-ID cross-refs with title).

## Output

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/report_critical_high.md:

```markdown
## Critical Findings

### [C-01] Title [VERIFIED]
[full section]

...

## High Findings

## Step 6c: Assembler Agent

> **Model**: haiku for ≤25 findings, sonnet for >25 findings (haiku truncated on large reports in prior audits)
> **Purpose**: Merges the three tier sections into the final AUDIT_REPORT.md with header, summary, remediation order, and optional appendix.

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="{haiku_or_sonnet}", prompt="
You are the Report Assembler. You merge the tier sections into the final audit report.

## Your Inputs
Read:
- {SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md (header info, summary counts, cross-reference map, excluded findings)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/report_critical_high.md (Critical + High sections)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/report_medium.md (Medium section)
- {SCRATCHPAD}/report_low_info.md (Low + Informational sections)
- ~/.claude/rules/report-template.md (report structure template)

## Your Task

### STEP 1: Assemble Report

Combine sections in this order:
1. **Report Header** - from report_index.md header info
2. **Executive Summary** - 2-3 paragraphs summarizing the audit (write this yourself based on the findings)
3. **Summary Table** - from report_index.md counts
4. **Components Audited Table** - from report_index.md
5. **Critical Findings** - paste from report_critical_high.md (Critical section)
6. **High Findings** - paste from report_critical_high.md (High section)
7. **Medium Findings** - paste from report_medium.md
8. **Low Findings** - paste from report_low_info.md (Low section)
9. **Informational Findings** - paste from report_low_info.md (Informational section)
10. **Priority Remediation Order** - generate from report_index.md, ordered: Critical → High → Medium
11. **Appendix A: Internal Audit Traceability** - from report_index.md (Master Finding Index + Excluded Findings)

### STEP 2: Quality Checks

Before writing, verify:
1. **Finding count matches summary** - count ### sections per severity tier, must equal summary table
2. **No internal IDs in body** - scan for [CS-, [AC-, [TF-, [BLIND-, [EN-, [SE-, [VS-, [DEPTH-, [SLITHER-, [RS-, [PC-, [SP-, [DST-, [DE-, [DX-, [DS-, [DT-, CH-, and bracketed H- followed by numbers. NONE should appear outside Appendix A.
3. **Cross-references valid** - check the cross-reference map from report_index.md, ensure referenced IDs exist
4. **No duplicate findings** - no two sections describe the same bug
5. **All tier files present** - if any tier file is missing or empty, note it as 'Section pending'

If any quality check fails, fix the issue in the assembled output. Document what was fixed.

### STEP 3: Write Final Report

Write the assembled report to: {PROJECT_ROOT}/AUDIT_REPORT.md

## Output

Write to {PROJECT_ROOT}/AUDIT_REPORT.md

Also write quality check results to {SCRATCHPAD}/report_quality.md:
```markdown
# Report Quality Check
- Finding count: {matches/mismatch} - Summary says X, sections have Y
- Internal ID leak: {CLEAN/FOUND} - [list any found]
- Cross-references: {VALID/BROKEN} - [list any broken]
- Duplicates: {NONE/FOUND} - [list any found]
- Missing tiers: {NONE/list}
- Fixes applied: [list any automatic fixes]
```

Return: 'DONE: Report assembled - {N} Critical, {N} High, {N} Medium, {N} Low, {N} Info - Quality: {PASS/ISSUES}'
")
```

> **Assembler Model Selection**: If total finding count from report_index.md > 25, use `model="sonnet"` instead of `model="haiku"`. Haiku truncates on large reports (learned from prior audits: 2,669-line report was truncated).
