# Self-Check Checklists - Solana

> **Usage**: Orchestrator reviews these checklists at the end of each phase.

- [ ] UNVERIFIED deps flagged with severity implications?
- [ ] BINDING MANIFEST present in template_recommendations.md?

## After Breadth (Before Phase 4a)

- [ ] All REQUIRED templates have agents spawned?
- [ ] spawn_manifest.md created?
- [ ] ACCOUNT_VALIDATION skill instantiated? (ALWAYS required for Solana)
- [ ] CPI_SECURITY skill instantiated if CPI flag detected?

- [ ] ORACLE (R16 Solana) checked if ORACLE flag detected?
- [ ] All expected analysis_*.md files exist?
- [ ] All findings have Step Execution fields?
- [ ] All findings have Rules Applied field (R1-R16, S1-S10)?

## After Inventory (Phase 4a)

- [ ] phase4_gates.md created?
- [ ] Fender findings promoted? (or grep-based findings promoted)
- [ ] Gate 1 (Spawn): If BLOCKED, missing agents re-spawned?
- [ ] Side effect trace audit completed? (CPI side effects traced)
- [ ] All CPI targets with side effects traced to termination?
- [ ] New [SE-N] findings created for uncovered side effect chains?

## After Adaptive Depth Loop (Phase 4b)

### Iteration 1 (full coverage)
- [ ] All 4 depth agents spawned?
- [ ] Blind Spot Scanner A spawned? (Token/account coverage, parameter coverage)
- [ ] Blind Spot Scanner B spawned? (Access control gaps, PDA seed collisions, remaining_accounts)
- [ ] Blind Spot Scanner C spawned? (Upgrade authority lifecycle, CPI target validation completeness)
- [ ] Validation Sweep Agent spawned?
- [ ] Account reload after CPI checked for all CPI sites? (S5)
- [ ] Token-2022 extension impact traced for all token accounts? (S9)
- [ ] CU worst-case tested for bounded loops? (R10)
- [ ] Revival attack prevention verified for all close operations? (S4)
- [ ] PDA seed collision analysis completed? (S2)
- [ ] Remaining accounts validation checked for all remaining_accounts usage? (S6)
- [ ] Duplicate mutable account attack checked? (S7)
- [ ] Sysvar spoofing checked? (S8)
- [ ] Depth evidence tags present ([BOUNDARY:*], [VARIATION:*], [TRACE:*])?

### Confidence Scoring
- [ ] consensus_map.md created (orchestrator inline)?
- [ ] Scoring agents spawned in domain batches (≤15 per batch)?
- [ ] confidence_scores.md written?
- [ ] confidence_distribution.md written?

### Adaptive Loop (iterations 2-3)
- [ ] Anti-dilution rules enforced? (AD-1 through AD-6: evidence-only carryover, no reasoning contamination, max 5 findings per agent, fresh tool calls, new-evidence-only re-scoring, error trace injection)
- [ ] Total depth spawns ≤ dynamic budget cap?
- [ ] adaptive_loop_log.md written?
- [ ] Budget redirect triggered if remaining_budget >= 3? (Design Stress Testing)

## After Chain Analysis (Phase 4c)

- [ ] Enabler enumeration completed (5 actor categories)?
- [ ] Anti-normalization check applied (Rule 13)?
- [ ] Anti-absorption rule applied?
- [ ] Chain analyzer read all depth/blind-spot/validation outputs?

## After Verification (Before Report)

- [ ] All chain hypotheses verified with PoC?
- [ ] All HIGH/CRITICAL verified with PoC?
- [ ] PoC uses LiteSVM for Solana programs?
- [ ] No [MOCK]/[EXT-UNV] evidence supports REFUTED?
- [ ] Post-verification finding extraction completed? (Phase 5.5)

## After Skeptic-Judge (Thorough mode only, after standard verification)

- [ ] All HIGH/CRIT findings received skeptic agent? (Thorough mode only)
- [ ] Skeptic agents used INVERSION MANDATE (opposite conclusion from standard)?
- [ ] Skeptic agents made their OWN tool calls (not reusing standard verifier output)?
- [ ] If skeptic DISAGREED: judge agent spawned with both verification files?
- [ ] Judge used strictly mechanical evidence hierarchy (POC-PASS > CODE-TRACE)?
- [ ] Final verdicts applied per ruling table (STANDARD_WINS/SKEPTIC_WINS/CONTESTED)?
- [ ] skeptic_*.md and judge_*.md files exist in scratchpad for all processed findings?

## After Report Generation (Phase 6)

- [ ] Quality gates passed? (every finding has own section, no internal IDs in body, finding count matches summary, cross-references valid, severity consistency)
- [ ] AUDIT_REPORT.md exists in project root?
- [ ] No internal pipeline IDs in report body?
- [ ] Finding counts match summary table?
