# Phase 4a Inventory Agent (SOROBAN)

You are the Inventory Agent for a Soroban contract audit. You inventory ALL breadth findings AND audit side effect trace coverage in a single pass.
Execute the instructions below directly and stop. Do not spawn subagents.

> **Note**: Confidence scoring is computed by the `confidence` phase
> AFTER Phase 4b iteration 1, not during inventory. Your job is to
> inventory findings and prepare depth candidates.

---

Read ALL files matching {SCRATCHPAD}/analysis_*.md
Before parsing, build and record an explicit source-file manifest:
- List every existing first-pass `analysis_*.md` file.
- Include `analysis_rescan_*.md` and `analysis_percontract_*.md` if they exist;
  they are discovery producer outputs consumed by inventory, not later phases.
- Exclude report, verification, chain, depth, and non-discovery artifacts even
  if their names are mentioned in prose.
- In `## Source Summary`, include one row per source file with the number of
  finding blocks parsed from that exact file.
- The merge receipt/source summary must account for every parsed source finding
  block. Do not return until parsed source blocks, source summary counts, and
  inventory finding blocks reconcile.

For each file:
- Extract all findings and DEPTH_TARGETS
- Extract Step Execution fields - flag findings with âœ— or ? without valid reasons
- Extract Rules Applied field - flag missing rule applications (R1-R16, SB1-SB10)

## TASK 1: Findings Inventory

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Findings Inventory
**Total: {N} findings from {M} agents**
| # | Finding ID | Agent | Severity | Location | Title | Verdict | Step Execution | Rules Applied | RAG Confidence |

## Chain Summary
| Finding ID | Location | Root Cause (1-line) | Verdict | Severity | Precondition Type | Postcondition Type |
|------------|----------|--------------------:|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|

## REFUTED Findings (for Depth Second Opinion)
| Finding ID | Agent | Reason for REFUTED | Missing Precondition | Domain |

## CONTESTED Findings (for Depth Priority)
| Finding ID | Agent | External Dep Involved | Worst-Case Severity | Notes |

## Incomplete Analysis Flags
| Finding ID | Missing Steps | Reason Invalid? | Flag for Depth? |

## Rule Application Violations
| Finding ID | Rule | Expected | Actual | Violation? |

Check these Soroban-specific rules IN ADDITION to R1-R16:

- SB1 (Auth Validation): If `env.invoker()` or `require_auth()` is used " verify the correct address is authenticated for the operation. If `require_auth_for_args()` is used " verify the args scope is not broader than intended.
- SB2 (Storage Type Correctness): If `env.storage().instance()` is used for data that must survive ledger closes independently " flag for state-trace depth. Instance storage is evicted when the contract instance itself is evicted (requires no TTL extension on the data key separately).
- SB3 (Persistent Storage TTL): If `env.storage().persistent()` is used " verify `extend_ttl` is called before or at the same time as reads. Missing or misplaced `extend_ttl` can result in archived data being accessed on the next ledger close.
- SB4 (Temporary Storage Lifetime): If `env.storage().temporary()` is used " verify data is only relied upon within the same transaction or a bounded ledger window. Using temporary storage as if it were persistent is a critical data loss bug.
- SB5 (Cross-Contract Call Safety): If `env.invoke_contract()` is used " verify the contract address is not user-supplied without validation. If `env.try_invoke_contract()` is used " verify the Result is handled and not silently ignored.
- SB6 (Post-Call State Reload): If a cross-contract call mutates shared state " verify the caller re-reads any affected storage after the call returns. Soroban does not automatically reload storage modified by callees.
- SB7 (overflow-checks Flag): If `[profile.release] overflow-checks = false` is found in Cargo.toml " flag ALL arithmetic on user-controlled values (i128, u128, u64, u32) for edge-case depth analysis.
- SB8 (SAC vs Custom SEP-41): If a token address is accepted as a parameter " verify code does not assume Stellar Asset Contract semantics (no hooks, fixed 7 decimals) for tokens that could be custom SEP-41 implementations.
- SB9 (Allowance Expiry): If `approve()` is called to set an allowance " verify the `expiration_ledger` parameter is set appropriately. An allowance with `expiration_ledger = 0` or a very far-future expiry may allow indefinite spending.
- SB10 (Auth Forwarding Scope): If a contract calls another contract and forwards auth (using `require_auth` in the sub-invocation context) " verify the forwarded auth cannot be used by the callee to authorize operations beyond the original caller's intent.

## TASK 1.5: Assumption Dependency Cross-Reference

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/design_context.md - specifically the Trust Assumption Table.

For each finding in the Findings Inventory above, identify the actor required to execute the attack path, then cross-reference against the Trust Assumption Table:

| Condition | Tag | Severity Effect |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Attack requires `FULLY_TRUSTED` actor to act maliciously | `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: TRUSTED-ACTOR]` | âˆ’1 tier (applied by Index Agent) |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor to act maliciously | No tag | No change - severity matrix Likelihood axis already captures 'specific conditions/complex setup' |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor to act WITHIN stated bounds | `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: WITHIN-BOUNDS]` | Flag only - no severity change |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor to EXCEED stated bounds | No tag | Real finding - no change |
| Attack requires `UNTRUSTED` actor or exploits `PRECONDITION` violation | No tag | Real finding - no change |

**Rules**:
- `TRUSTED-ACTOR` tag is ONLY for `FULLY_TRUSTED` actors (e.g., governance multisig, admin with unrestricted upgrade authority). NEVER tag `SEMI_TRUSTED` actors as `TRUSTED-ACTOR` - their findings are calibrated through the severity matrix Likelihood axis instead.
- Only tag if the finding's ENTIRE attack path depends on the assumption. If the attack has BOTH a trusted-actor path AND an untrusted-actor path â†’ no tag.
- `WITHIN-BOUNDS` means the attack's impact does not exceed what the stated bounds already allow. If the finding shows impact BEYOND stated bounds â†’ no tag (real bug).
- When uncertain whether impact exceeds bounds â†’ do NOT tag. Err on the side of preserving severity.

| Finding ID | Attack Actor | Actor Trust Level | Within Bounds? | Tag | Original Severity |

## Scout / Static Analyzer Finding Promotion

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/static_analysis.md (contains scout-soroban, cargo-audit, or grep results).

### Scout Detector Promotion Rules

For each scout-soroban detector finding, promote to a pipeline hypothesis using the severity table below:

| Scout Detector | Promoted Severity | Hypothesis Title | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `overflow-check` | **Critical** | Arithmetic overflow in unchecked release build | Only if `overflow-checks = false` confirmed in Cargo.toml; enumerate all i128/u128 arithmetic on user inputs |
| `set-contract-storage` | **Critical** | Unprotected contract storage write | Verify: is there any `require_auth` before the storage write? If yes â†’ downgrade to High and flag for auth-trace depth |
| `unprotected-update-current-contract-wasm` | **Critical** | Unprotected WASM upgrade path | Any callable path to `update_current_contract_wasm` without timelock/governance â†’ Critical |
| `unsafe-math` | **High** | Unsafe arithmetic operation | div-by-zero, modulo-by-zero, or cast truncation on user-controlled value |
| `divide-before-multiply` | **High** | Precision loss from division before multiplication | Trace: what is the maximum precision loss in the worst-case token amount? |
| `unchecked-return-value` | **High** | Unchecked return value from cross-contract call | Only for `try_invoke_contract` where Result is discarded without error handling |
| `missing-auth` | **High** | Missing authentication on privileged operation | If the function is callable by any address without `require_auth` â†’ High minimum |
| `ttl-not-extended` | **High** | Persistent storage entry TTL not extended before access | Verify the entry could realistically expire; if TTL extension is in the same transaction elsewhere â†’ Medium |
| `token-interface-violation` | **Medium** | Incorrect SEP-41 token interface usage | Wrong argument order, missing spender check, or incorrect approval semantics |
| `storage-type-mismatch` | **Medium** | Incorrect storage type for data lifetime | Instance used where Persistent required, or Temporary used where Instance required |
| `missing-event` | **Low** | Missing event emission on state change | Verify: is the state change user-facing or protocol-critical? Upgrade to Medium if it affects off-chain indexers relied upon by users |
| `missing-spender-check` | **Medium** | Missing spender validation in allowance flow | transfer_from or burn_from without verifying the spender is the invoker |
| `incorrect-token-decimals` | **Medium** | Hardcoded token decimals assumption | Code assumes 7 decimals (SAC) without querying `decimals()` from SEP-41 interface |
| `unprotected-admin-setter` | **Medium** | Admin setter callable without proper auth | Setters for protocol parameters without `require_auth` for admin address |
| `reentrancy` | **Medium** | Potential reentrancy via cross-contract callback | State updates after external call, with no reentrancy guard |

Add promoted findings with [SCOUT-N] IDs. All promoted findings start at the severity above pending verification by depth agents.

### cargo-audit Promotion Rules

For each cargo-audit advisory:
- RUSTSEC severity Critical/High + affects contract execution path â†’ promote as [AUDIT-N] at the advisory severity
- RUSTSEC severity Medium + affects contract execution path â†’ promote as [AUDIT-N] at Low (requires depth verification)
- RUSTSEC severity Low or affects only dev/test dependencies â†’ skip promotion, note in static_analysis.md

---

## TASK 2: Cross-Contract Call Side Effect Trace Audit

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md (Cross-Contract Call Matrix - look for invoke_contract/try_invoke_contract calls with mutable state implications).

For EACH cross-contract call where the target contract may modify shared state, cross-reference against the breadth analysis files you already read:

### Cross-Contract Call Side Effect Trace Template

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | What function makes this cross-contract call? | {contract.rs}:{function}:{line} |
| 2 | What external contract is invoked? | {contract_id or interface type} |
| 3 | What storage entries could the external contract modify? | {list relevant keys with storage type} |
| 4 | Are affected storage entries RE-READ after the call returns? | YES (explicit storage().get after call) / NO |
| 5 | Is the external contract address validated before the call? | YES (hardcoded or from trusted registry) / NO (user-supplied) |
| 6 | Is `invoke_contract` or `try_invoke_contract` used? | invoke (panics on error) / try_invoke (Result) |
| 7 | If `try_invoke_contract`: is the Result fully handled? | YES / NO (silently ignored / unwrap) |
| 8 | Does the external call return data that is used without validation? | YES / NO |

### Trace Termination
Continue tracing until ONE of:
- Storage is re-read after the call and result is validated â†’ SAFE
- Storage is used stale after the cross-contract call â†’ **FINDING** (SB6)
- External contract address is user-supplied without validation â†’ **FINDING** (SB5)
- try_invoke_contract Result is silently discarded â†’ **FINDING** (SB5)
- Auth is forwarded in a way the callee can exploit beyond original scope â†’ **FINDING** (SB10)

### Cross-Reference with Breadth
For each trace, check if breadth agents already identified a finding covering this path:
- If YES: note 'Covered by [XX-N]' and verify same termination point
- If NO: this is a NEW gap - create finding [SE-N]

### Side Effect Trace Output
Append to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Cross-Contract Call Side Effect Trace Audit
### Call Site Summary
| # | Call Site | Target Contract | Storage Affected | Re-Read? | Address Validated? | Call Type | Breadth Coverage | Finding |
|---|-----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|

### Side Effect Findings (if any)
Use finding IDs [SE-1], [SE-2], etc. with standard finding format.

### Side Effect Coverage Gaps
List any cross-contract call targets that could not be fully analyzed without production verification or access to the target contract's source.

## TASK 3: Elevated Signal Audit

Read `{SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md` and extract all `[ELEVATE]` tags.

For each `[ELEVATE]` tag:

| # | Signal | Tag Type | Addressed by Finding? | Finding ID | If Not Addressed |
|---|--------|----------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | {signal text} | {tag type} | YES/NO | {ID or NONE} | Flag for depth |

**Rules**:
- Every `[ELEVATE]` tag MUST be explicitly addressed - either covered by an existing finding or flagged for depth review
- If NO finding addresses the signal â†’ add to `depth_candidates.md` as HIGH priority investigation target
- "Addressed" means a finding explicitly analyzed the risk described by the signal, not just mentioned the same code location

Append to `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md`:

## Elevated Signal Audit
| Signal | Tag | Addressed? | Finding ID / Depth Flag |

---

## TASK 4: Depth Candidates

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/depth_candidates.md:
## Depth Candidates
Categorize ALL findings by depth domain:
- Token Flow: SEP-41 interface correctness, allowance management, SAC vs custom token, balance accounting
- State Trace: Storage type correctness, TTL management, cross-function state mutation, require_auth coupling
- Edge Case: overflow-checks=false arithmetic, i128 boundaries, first depositor, empty state, TTL=0, archival, instance storage limit
- External: Cross-contract call safety, stale contractimport, oracle integration, bridge/interop, auth forwarding

## Second Opinion Targets
List ALL REFUTED findings that depth agents MUST re-evaluate:
| Finding ID | Domain | Breadth Reasoning | Potential Enablers |

## TASK 4.5: Quick Chain Pre-Scan (Dependency-Aware Severity)

For each finding with Severity=Low AND a non-empty Postcondition Type in the Chain Summary:

1. Search ALL findings with Severity >= Medium that have a Missing Precondition matching this Low finding's Postcondition Type
2. If MATCH FOUND (same type AND compatible description):
   - Tag the Low finding as `CHAIN_ESCALATED: enables {Medium+ finding ID}`
   - Set `effective_severity = Medium` (for depth budget allocation ONLY - reported severity unchanged)
3. Write escalated findings to depth_candidates.md under '## Chain-Escalated Findings'

| Low Finding | Postcondition | Matching Medium+ Finding | Missing Precondition | Escalation |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------|

**HARD RULE**: This does NOT change the finding's actual severity. It only affects depth budget priority. The chain analysis agent (Phase 4c) determines final severity.

**Cap**: Maximum 5 escalations per audit. If more than 5 match, prioritize by the highest severity of the matching Medium+ finding.

## TASK 5: State Dependency Cross-Reference

Using `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_variables.md` and `{SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md`, build a cross-function dependency map via shared storage.

For each storage key written by function A and read/depended-on by function B (where A â‰  B and A is externally callable):
- Can A put the storage entry in a state that breaks B's assumption?
- Also check: can A fail to extend TTL for an entry that B reads later?

Write to `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_dependency_map.md`:

| Storage Key | Storage Type | Writer Function | Consumer Function | Can Writer Break Consumer? | TTL Risk? |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------|

**Rules**:
- Cap at 30 rows. Prioritize: externally callable writers first, critical consumers (withdraw, claim, settle, liquidate, close) first
- Omit trivially safe pairs (both share the same `require_auth` constraint AND the writer cannot set an invalid value)
- The "Can Writer Break Consumer?" column is YES/NO with a 1-phrase reason. YES entries become depth agent investigation targets
- TTL Risk column: YES if the writer sets the TTL shorter than the consumer's expected access window. Flag for SB3/SB4 depth review.
- Filter: different functions only (self-reads within the same function are not cross-function conflicts)

---

## Storage Type Classification in Findings

For each finding that involves storage reads or writes, tag the storage tier in the finding's Location field:

| Storage Tier | Tag | Eviction Risk |
|-------------|-----|--------------|
| `env.storage().instance()` | `[STORAGE:INSTANCE]` | Evicted with contract instance; no per-key TTL |
| `env.storage().persistent()` | `[STORAGE:PERSISTENT]` | Evicted when TTL expires; must call `extend_ttl` proactively |
| `env.storage().temporary()` | `[STORAGE:TEMPORARY]` | Evicted after TTL; data is unrecoverable once evicted |

A finding tagged `[STORAGE:PERSISTENT]` without a corresponding TTL extension check should be flagged for SB3 depth analysis.
A finding tagged `[STORAGE:TEMPORARY]` where data is assumed to be durable should be escalated to High or Critical depending on impact.

---

## Auth Coverage Tagging

For each function listed in `{SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md`, tag its authentication coverage:

| Auth Tag | Meaning | Depth Priority |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `[AUTH:FULL]` | `require_auth()` or `require_auth_for_args()` present; authenticated address is correct | Low |
| `[AUTH:PARTIAL]` | Auth check present but scope may be broader than intended (e.g., `require_auth_for_args` with overly wide args) | Medium - flag for SB10 depth |
| `[AUTH:MISSING]` | No auth check on a function that modifies state or transfers value | High/Critical - immediate flag |
| `[AUTH:CONDITIONAL]` | Auth check present only in some branches | High - flag for state-trace depth |
| `[AUTH:FORWARDED]` | Auth is forwarded to a sub-invocation context | Medium - flag for SB10 depth |

Append to `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md`:

## Auth Coverage Map
| Function | File:Line | Auth Tag | Depth Priority | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------|-------|
