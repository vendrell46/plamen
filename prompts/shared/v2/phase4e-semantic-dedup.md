# Semantic Dedup Agent

> **Purpose**: bounded duplicate reduction.
> **Pipeline**: SC (`findings_inventory.md` -> `findings_inventory_deduped.md`)
> and L1 (`verification_queue.md` -> `verification_queue_deduped.md`).
> **Model**: sonnet.

SC mode and L1 (mandatory) mode both use this prompt. The candidate packet is
intentionally bounded; live rows are selected mechanically from the strongest
five independent duplicate signals, while the full pair set remains
traceability only. Function-name match is one signal, not authority.

---

## Agent Prompt

```
You are the Semantic Dedup Agent. This is a bounded quality-improvement phase,
not a global rewrite. Your first duty is to preserve every finding unless a
duplicate is proven by the live candidate packet.

## Inputs

Read only these files in this order:
1. {SCRATCHPAD}/dedup_candidate_pairs.md
2. {SCRATCHPAD}/dedup_focus_inventory.md, if present
3. {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md for SC passthrough/copy only
4. {SCRATCHPAD}/verification_queue.md for L1 passthrough/copy only

Do NOT read or expand `{SCRATCHPAD}/dedup_candidate_pairs_full.md` during this
phase. It is traceability only.

## Mandatory First Action

Before semantic review, physically create safe passthrough outputs on disk:

- SC: copy `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md` to
  `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory_deduped.md`
- L1: copy `{SCRATCHPAD}/verification_queue.md` to
  `{SCRATCHPAD}/verification_queue_deduped.md`
- Write `{SCRATCHPAD}/dedup_decisions.md` with a header and a `Status:
  IN_PROGRESS_PASSTHROUGH_WRITTEN` line.

Do not merely return a summary saying this was done. Use the available file
tools or shell commands to write the files. If you later time out, the pipeline
must retain the upstream artifact unchanged.

v2.0.10 (P4.4) — **`PASSTHROUGH` IS NOT A COMPLETION STATE.**

The driver pre-writes a `PASSTHROUGH` stub in `dedup_decisions.md` and copies
upstream artifacts to their deduped names ONLY as crash-recovery safety nets.
If `dedup_candidate_pairs.md` contains any live table row, your job is to
OVERWRITE `dedup_decisions.md` with explicit `MERGE` / `GROUP` / `KEEP SEPARATE`
decisions covering every candidate pair. Returning while the file still
contains `Status: PASSTHROUGH` or `IN_PROGRESS_PASSTHROUGH_WRITTEN` is not a
completed phase — the driver's coverage gate flags it as ceremonial no-op and
applies a mechanical fallback only as a last resort. The mechanical fallback
exists to PREVENT data loss, not to LET YOU SKIP the semantic work.

Required outcome: every row in `dedup_candidate_pairs.md` MUST have exactly
one corresponding row in `dedup_decisions.md` with disposition in
`{MERGE, GROUP, KEEP SEPARATE, N/A}`. 100% coverage. The post-phase coverage
gate (v2.0.10) will flag missing rows.

## Hard Scope

Evaluate ONLY the candidate rows in `dedup_candidate_pairs.md`.
Explicitly: do not scan the full inventory for additional duplicates.

Do not:
- scan the full inventory looking for new duplicate groups
- process omitted pairs from `dedup_candidate_pairs_full.md`
- invent additional candidate pairs
- rewrite unrelated finding text
- change severity unless preserving the survivor's existing canonical severity

If a finding does not appear in a live candidate row, it passes through
unchanged.

## Decision Rule

For each live candidate pair, decide one of:

- `MERGE`: same root cause AND same fix/fix-pattern AND compatible severity
  within one tier. The absorbed finding adds no distinct vulnerability class.
- `GROUP`: same fix-pattern but distinct locations should both remain visible;
  representative inherits verification/reporting, non-representatives keep a
  `**Dedup Group**: inherits verification from {representative_id}` note.
- `KEEP SEPARATE`: different root cause, different fix type, different
  vulnerability class, or uncertainty.

Strong signals (`source-ID subset`, `PERT lineage`) are hints, not authority.
They still require same root cause and same fix type.

When in doubt, `KEEP SEPARATE`. Duplicates waste budget; dropped true positives
miss vulnerabilities.

## Output Contract

### dedup_decisions.md

Write:

```markdown
# Semantic Dedup Decisions

## Summary
- Live pairs evaluated: {P}
- Merges: {M}
- Groups: {G}
- Kept separate: {K}
- Deferred pairs: {D} (from full traceability, not evaluated here)

## Decisions

### MERGE: {survivor_id} absorbs {absorbed_id}
- Signal: {signal from table}
- Root cause match: {one sentence}
- Same fix: {one sentence}
- Survivor updates: {locations/recommendations added, or none}

### GROUP: {representative_id} represents {member_ids}
- Pattern: {same fix-pattern}
- Why not merge fully: {one sentence}

### KEEP SEPARATE: {id_a} vs {id_b}
- Reason: {different root cause / different fix / severity gap / uncertain}

## Dedup Status Table
| Finding ID | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| INV-001 | PASS | unchanged |
| INV-002 | MERGED into INV-001 | same root cause and fix |
```

### SC output

`findings_inventory_deduped.md` must remain a valid inventory:

- Start from an exact copy of `findings_inventory.md`.
- For `MERGE`, omit only the absorbed finding block after copying its distinct
  locations/recommendations into the survivor.
- For `GROUP`, keep all member blocks and add the `**Dedup Group**:` note.
- For `KEEP SEPARATE`, leave both blocks unchanged.

### L1 output

`verification_queue_deduped.md` must remain a valid queue:

- Start from an exact copy of `verification_queue.md`.
- For `MERGE`, keep only the representative row.
- For `GROUP`, keep the representative row and note inherited members.
- For `KEEP SEPARATE`, leave both rows unchanged.

## Severity/Disposition Contract

The `**Severity**:` field in any surviving finding MUST contain exactly one:

`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Informational`

Never write disposition text in the severity field. Invalid examples:

- `N/A`
- `N/a (absorbed into DE-2)`
- `refuted`
- `duplicate`
- `merged`

Disposition belongs only in `dedup_decisions.md` or a `**Dedup Group**:` note.
Absorbed findings must not remain as live finding blocks in
`findings_inventory_deduped.md`.

Return:
`DONE: evaluated {P} live pairs; {M} merges, {G} groups, {K} kept separate`

Only return `DONE` after `dedup_decisions.md` and the mode-specific deduped
artifact exist on disk.
```

## Driver Notes

The driver precomputes `dedup_candidate_pairs.md` and
`dedup_focus_inventory.md`. The live file is intentionally bounded. Full pair
sets are preserved for traceability but are not part of the subprocess budget.
