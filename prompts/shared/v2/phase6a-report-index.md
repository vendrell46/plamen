## Your Inputs

Read:
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/verify_core.md` - **OPTIONAL but primary when present**. Both current SC and L1 pipelines normally produce this via the verification aggregate phase. When absent, enumerate `verify_*.md` files directly and derive the per-hypothesis verdicts from them. Do NOT fail the phase on its absence.
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/rag_validation.md` (historical support / contradiction)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/finding_mapping.md` (hypothesis -> agent finding mapping)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/contract_inventory.md` (SC component list for report header, if present)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/subsystem_map.md` (L1 component/subsystem list for report header, if present)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md` (complete agent finding inventory)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/recon_summary.md` (audit themes and risk areas)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/design_context.md` (SC project context, if present)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/threat_model.md` (L1 project context, if present)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/build_status.md` (SC build/static-analysis status, if present)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/primitive_status.md` (L1 primitive bake/static-analysis status, if present)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/template_recommendations.md` (recommended niche/analysis lanes)
- If `verify_core.md` exists and already provides the needed status, do NOT open `finding_mapping.md`, raw depth findings, or scanner findings up front. Treat those as fallback-only inputs for missing detail, not default reads.
- If `verify_core.md` is absent, read `verify_*.md` files directly - each contains its own hypothesis ID and verdict header.
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/depth_*_findings.md` (raw depth findings and chain summaries)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/blind_spot_*_findings.md` or `{SCRATCHPAD}/scanner_*_findings.md` (scanner findings)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/validation_sweep_findings.md` or `{SCRATCHPAD}/scanner_validation_findings.md` (validation findings)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/dedup_candidate_pairs.md` (OPTIONAL — pre-computed same-file finding pairs with high title overlap or shared code identifiers, produced by the depth promotion pipeline. Use as HINTS for Step 1.5 consolidation.)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/poc_demotions.md` (OPTIONAL — mechanically-computed severity caps for findings where PoC execution disproved the claimed harm. If present, apply caps in STEP 1 rule 7.)

Forbidden inputs:
- Do NOT read `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md`, `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_coverage.md`,
  or any `*.attempt*` file when a retry hint is present. Previous report-index
  outputs are known-bad artifacts, not evidence.
- Do NOT read `_prompt_*`, `_stdio_*`, `tool_calls.jsonl`, `_retry_quarantine/`,
  or `_overflow/`.

Verification verdicts: Read from `{SCRATCHPAD}/verify_core.md` (summary index of
all per-ID verifier results) and individual `{SCRATCHPAD}/verify_*.md` files when
needed. For Thorough mode, also read `{SCRATCHPAD}/skeptic_findings.md` and
`{SCRATCHPAD}/skeptic_judge_decisions.md` when present. If the run produced
legacy shard outputs, also read `{SCRATCHPAD}/judge_*.md`. These artifacts are
the authority for HIGH/CRIT severity overrides and UNRESOLVED/PARTIAL demotions.

---

## Severity Authority Contract (READ BEFORE TIERING)

Report indexing is a mapping task, not a new severity-assessment phase. Do NOT
recalibrate severity from your own impact judgment, economic intuition, title
wording, or evidence tag. The final report tier must be mechanically derived
from upstream severity plus explicit, auditable adjustment rules.

For every Master Finding Index row:

1. Read the mapped `verify_<ID>.md` file and the matching
   `verification_queue.md` row.
2. The row's final `Severity` and Report ID prefix (`C-`, `H-`, `M-`, `L-`,
   `I-`) MUST match the upstream verifier/queue severity unless one of the
   canonical adjustments below applies.
3. `[CODE-TRACE]` does NOT imply Low. When `PROVEN_ONLY: false`, a
   Medium/High/Critical `[CODE-TRACE]` finding stays at its upstream severity.
4. If final severity differs from upstream, the `Trust Adj.` column MUST
   contain one canonical reason with the original severity:
   - `TRUSTED-ACTOR(original_sev)`
   - `UNRESOLVED(original_sev)` or `PARTIAL(original_sev)`
   - `POC-FAIL(original_sev)`
   - `PROVEN(original_sev)` only when `PROVEN_ONLY: true`
   - `CHAIN-UPGRADE(original_sev)` / `CHAIN-DOWNGRADE(original_sev)` with the
     chain ID and enabling relation
5. A bare `-` / `—` Trust Adj. is valid only when final severity equals
   upstream severity.
6. If no canonical adjustment applies, restore the upstream severity and
   matching report-ID tier. Do not silently move Medium verified findings into
   Low rows, and do not silently upgrade Informational findings to Low.

## STEP 1: Determine Final Severities

For each hypothesis, apply this priority order:

1. If a verifier returned a verdict -> use verifier's final severity
2. If chain analysis upgraded severity -> use upgraded severity
3. Otherwise -> use the severity from hypotheses.md
4. **Apply trust assumption downgrades**: Check `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md` for `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: TRUSTED-ACTOR]` tags. For tagged findings, apply -1 tier severity downgrade (floor: Informational). Note the original severity and downgrade reason in the Master Finding Index under a "Trust Adj." column. For `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: WITHIN-BOUNDS]` tags: do NOT change severity, but note the flag in the index for tier writers to include as context. **Mechanical enforcement**: The Index Agent MUST NOT override, remove, or selectively skip Inventory Agent tags. If a finding has the `TRUSTED-ACTOR` tag, apply the downgrade. If it does not have the tag, do not downgrade. No exceptions for chain upgrades, verification results, or analytical reasoning — the Inventory Agent is the sole authority on trust tagging.
5. **Proven-only demotion** (ONLY if the resolved configuration says `PROVEN_ONLY: true`): For each finding whose BEST evidence tag is `[CODE-TRACE]` (no `[POC-PASS]`, `[MEDUSA-PASS]`, `[PROD-ONCHAIN]`, `[PROD-SOURCE]`, or `[PROD-FORK]`), cap severity at Low. Record the original severity in the "Trust Adj." column as `PROVEN(original_sev)`. Count total demotions for the report header note: *"Proven-only mode enabled: {N} findings capped at Low from {severities} due to unproven evidence ([CODE-TRACE] only)."* If `PROVEN_ONLY: false`, this rule is disabled and `[CODE-TRACE]` does not change severity.

   **v2.0.8 (P3) — evidence source authority**: "BEST evidence tag" means the value from `{SCRATCHPAD}/verdict_manifest.json` `effective_tag` field, NOT the verifier's prose `Evidence Tag` field. The verdict manifest is the canonical machine-readable record written by the driver after mechanical PoC execution. A verifier file that prose-claims `[POC-PASS]` but whose mechanical execution returned `NO_TEST_FILE` / `FAIL` is flagged `integrity_state: INFLATED_PROSE` and has `effective_tag` downgraded to `[CODE-TRACE] [INTEGRITY-DOWNGRADE]`. Use the effective_tag in all evidence-comparison logic. Do NOT inflate findings back to `[POC-PASS]` based on prose alone.
6. **UNRESOLVED demotion + body retention** : For any finding where the Skeptic-Judge phase returned `UNRESOLVED` **OR `PARTIAL`** (both tokens carry identical semantics — verifier and skeptic disagree, no clean resolution) in any `skeptic_*.md` or `judge_*.md` artifact in the scratchpad, apply -1 tier severity downgrade (floor: Low). Record the original severity in the Trust Adj. column as `UNRESOLVED(original_sev)`. **The finding REMAINS in the report body** — it is NOT routed to Appendix A. The tier writer flags it as `[UNRESOLVED — needs human review]` per the report-template.md format. **Hard rule**: an UNRESOLVED finding in the Excluded Findings table is a workflow violation.

   **CONTESTED is NOT UNRESOLVED — do not conflate them.** A verifier verdict of `CONTESTED` (found in `verify_*.md` / `verify_core.md`) is a *verifier* outcome; it is NOT a Skeptic-Judge ruling. Do NOT stamp `UNRESOLVED(...)` on a finding merely because its verifier verdict is `CONTESTED`. A `CONTESTED` finding keeps its upstream verifier severity, stays in the report body, and is written with the `[CONTESTED]` status header per report-template.md's `[VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED/CONTESTED]` format — **no tier demotion, no `UNRESOLVED` Trust Adj.** The `UNRESOLVED(original_sev)` stamp is valid ONLY when a literal `UNRESOLVED` or `PARTIAL` ruling token for that finding appears in `skeptic_judge_decisions.md`, a `skeptic_*.md`, or a `judge_*.md` file. If the run produced no Skeptic-Judge artifact at all (Light and Core modes do not run Skeptic-Judge), then `UNRESOLVED(...)` MUST NOT appear anywhere in the Master Finding Index. The driver mechanically rejects phantom `UNRESOLVED(...)` stamps and will retry this phase.
7. **PoC-fail demotion** : If `{SCRATCHPAD}/poc_demotions.md` exists, read it. For each finding listed, apply the severity cap from the table. Record the original severity in the Trust Adj. column as `POC-FAIL(original_sev)`. These findings REMAIN in the report body at their capped severity (not excluded). The tier writer includes: *"PoC execution disproved the claimed harm — test executed but the system behaved correctly. Capped from {original} to {capped}."* **Mechanical enforcement**: The driver computes these demotions from `[POC-FAIL]` evidence tags in verify files. The Index Agent MUST NOT override, remove, or selectively skip entries in `poc_demotions.md`.

8. **Speculative-Critical cap (T2-c)** : `Critical` is the highest-impact tier and must not be assigned to unproven speculation. A `Critical` severity assigned to a **chain / compound hypothesis** (`CH-*`, or any finding whose claimed impact depends on combining multiple sub-findings that are not each independently confirmed) MUST be capped at `High` UNLESS the chain itself has verifier confirmation — i.e. a `verify_*.md` for the chain (or all its constituents) with `[POC-PASS]` / `[MEDUSA-PASS]` evidence and a `VERIFIED` disposition. An unverified speculative chain is `High` at most. Critical requires EITHER (a) verifier-confirmed exploitation, OR (b) a single, directly-demonstrated fund-loss / permanent-lock mechanism in one finding. When you apply this cap, record `CHAIN-DOWNGRADE(Critical)` in the Trust Adj. column with the chain ID. The driver logs any surviving unverified Critical chain for review.

---

## STEP 1.25: Client-Worthiness Triage (CONSERVATIVE)

This step reduces client-report bloat without deleting traceability. It is a
triage decision for presentation, not a new vulnerability-analysis phase.

For each verified or mapped candidate, assign exactly one triage status:

- `REPORTABLE`: client-facing report body section.
- `MERGE_INTO:<report-or-internal-id>`: same root cause, same fix, no semantic
  loss; preserve source ID in the Consolidation Map.
- `APPENDIX_ONLY`: true or plausible observation, but not client-body material.
- `DROP_FALSE_POSITIVE`: verifier explicitly refuted the claim or showed the
  claimed harm cannot occur.
- `DROP_NON_SECURITY`: behavior is not a security issue and has no plausible
  loss, privilege, liveness, accounting, integrity, or observability impact.
- `DROP_DESIGN_CONFIRMATION`: the item only confirms expected behavior or an
  intentionally safe design property.
- `DROP_UNACTIONABLE_SPECULATION`: speculative claim with no reachable path,
  no concrete impacted actor, and no actionable fix after verification.
- `UNRESOLVED_EVIDENCE`: contested or low-confidence candidate with no
  reproducible code path, no trace, or insufficient evidence after the prior
  analysis/verification phases.

Safety rules:

1. Never silently delete a candidate. Non-`REPORTABLE` candidates MUST appear in
   `report_coverage.md` and either the Consolidation Map or Excluded Findings.
2. Medium+ verified candidates default to `REPORTABLE`. They may be moved out
   of the body only when the verifier/judge evidence explicitly supports
   `DROP_FALSE_POSITIVE`, `DROP_NON_SECURITY`, `MERGE_INTO`, or
   `UNRESOLVED_EVIDENCE` with a reason that names the missing reproducible
   path, trace, proof, support, or sufficient evidence.
3. Low/Informational candidates may be `APPENDIX_ONLY` when true but minor,
   repetitive, non-exploitable, or primarily operational/documentation quality.
4. Design confirmations, positive properties, safe invariants, and
   "works as intended" rows are not report-body findings. Use
   `DROP_DESIGN_CONFIRMATION` unless they are needed as context for a real
   reportable issue.
5. Do not use triage to hide uncertainty. If a candidate has credible loss or
   safety impact and is not refuted, keep it `REPORTABLE` or `APPENDIX_ONLY`
   with a clear reason.
6. A report that is structurally complete but contains dozens of weak,
   repetitive, design-confirmation, or non-security body sections is a quality
   failure. Prefer a smaller client body plus complete traceability.
7. **Stub findings (T2-c)**: A candidate that names neither a concrete
   vulnerability MECHANISM (how the bug is triggered — the specific call,
   state, or sequence) NOR a concrete IMPACT (what is lost, corrupted, or
   locked, and who is harmed) is a stub. Assign it
   `DROP_UNACTIONABLE_SPECULATION`. Do NOT emit a report-body section for a
   finding that cannot state both a mechanism and an impact — a body section
   that only restates a function name with no triggerable path and no loss is
   noise, not a finding.

Use the existing `Excluded Findings` table for `APPENDIX_ONLY` and `DROP_*`
statuses. The Exclusion Reason MUST begin with the exact triage status token
above, followed by a concise evidence-based reason.

---

## STEP 1.5: Root-Cause Consolidation (MANDATORY)

Before assigning report IDs, consolidate hypotheses that share the same root cause into single report findings. This prevents inflated finding counts from pipeline fragmentation.

**This step is MANDATORY and is routinely under-applied.** Pipeline fragmentation typically produces 2-4 separate hypotheses per real root cause (a breadth finding, its depth re-discovery, a scanner hit, a per-contract hit). If you emit roughly as many report findings as there are raw inventory entries, you almost certainly skipped consolidation. Actively scan for the common patterns in the table below and merge aggressively where the consolidation test passes — a de-inflated report of real findings is the goal.

### Pre-computed Hints

Two sources of dedup signals exist. Both are HINTS — the LLM makes the final semantic decision using the consolidation test below. Neither source ever blocks or removes findings mechanically.

1. **`[LIKELY-DUP]` tags in `findings_inventory.md`**: Depth-promoted findings that share the same file AND >=80% title overlap with an existing inventory entry carry a `**Dedup Signal**: [LIKELY-DUP of "..." score=X.XX]` line. These are the strongest mechanical signal — evaluate them first. If the two findings describe the SAME root cause with the SAME fix, consolidate. If they describe different bugs that happen to use similar words, keep them separate.

2. **`dedup_candidate_pairs.md`**: Pre-computed same-file finding pairs with >=50% title overlap or shared function/struct identifiers. Broader than `[LIKELY-DUP]` — evaluate each pair using the consolidation test below.

**When in doubt, do NOT merge.** A duplicate finding in the report is a cosmetic issue. A dropped true positive is a missed vulnerability.

### Semantic Retention Rule

During consolidation, preserve the semantic content already established upstream. For each candidate, carry forward the broken invariant, branch preconditions, terminal failure mechanism, verification disposition, and source IDs when those details are present in the bounded inputs (`verify_core.md`, `verify_*.md`, `finding_mapping.md`, `findings_inventory.md`, and the dedup hints). This is retention, not rediscovery: do not perform fresh vulnerability analysis, and do not bulk-read raw breadth/depth/scanner artifacts by default. If a single candidate is missing detail needed to avoid dropping semantics, read only the minimal fallback source for that candidate.

### Consolidation Test

Merge two hypotheses into ONE report finding if ALL of these are true:
1. **Same fix pattern**: Both require the same TYPE of code change
2. **Same severity tier**: Both are in the same tier after STEP 1 adjustments
3. **Same vulnerability class**: Both are instances of the same bug pattern
4. **Describable together**: A reader can understand all affected locations from a single description + location table
5. **No semantic loss**: The merged finding can preserve every distinct broken invariant, branch precondition, terminal failure mechanism, verification disposition, and source ID in its title/description, locations, Consolidation Reason, or coverage ledger

### Do NOT Merge If

- Findings are in different severity tiers
- The root causes are genuinely different (e.g., "missing event" vs "wrong event parameters")
- Merging would exceed 6 locations per finding (split into 2 findings for readability)
- Merging would drop, blur, or overwrite a distinct branch precondition or terminal failure mechanism. If two candidates fail through different branches or end in different mechanisms, keep them separate unless the shared report finding can state both without ambiguity.

### Common Consolidation Patterns

| Pattern | Example Hypotheses | Consolidated Title |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Missing events on state changes | "setX no event" + "setY no event" + "setZ no event" | "Missing event emission on admin state changes" |
| Admin setters accept zero/invalid | "paramA accepts zero" + "paramB accepts zero" | "Admin setters lack zero-value validation" |
| Missing staleness checks | "no staleness on X" + "no max staleness on Y" | "Rate provider staleness not validated" |
| Retroactive parameter changes | "paramA retroactive" + "paramB retroactive" | "Global parameter changes retroactively affect pending state" |
| Same-role trust findings | "ROLE can do X" + "ROLE can do Y" (same role, same trust level) | "ROLE capabilities exceed stated trust level" |

### Output

For each consolidation, record:
```
CONSOLIDATED: H-{A} + H-{B} [+ H-{C}...] -> single finding
  Title: {consolidated title}
  Locations: {list all affected locations}
  Severity: {shared severity}
  Internal refs: {all absorbed hypothesis IDs}
```

In the `Consolidation Reason` free-text field, include the shared root cause and fix pattern, plus any preserved semantic distinctions that matter for downstream writing: broken invariant, branch precondition, terminal mechanism, verification disposition, and source IDs. Do not add columns to the Master Finding Index.

Hypotheses NOT consolidated remain as standalone findings.

---

## STEP 2: Assign Report IDs

Sort all findings (consolidated and standalone) by severity tier, then by verification status (VERIFIED first), then by impact.

Assign clean sequential IDs:
- Critical: C-01, C-02, ...
- High: H-01, H-02, ...
- Medium: M-01, M-02, ...
- Low: L-01, L-02, ...
- Informational: I-01, I-02, ...

---

## STEP 3: Create Tier Assignments

Assign each finding to exactly ONE tier writer:
- **Critical+High Tier**: All C-XX and H-XX findings
- **Medium Tier**: All M-XX findings
- **Low+Info Tier**: All L-XX and I-XX findings

---

## STEP 4: Create Cross-Reference Map

For chain findings that reference component findings, note the cross-references using REPORT IDs only.
Example: If chain hypothesis CH-1 (now C-01) references standalone hypothesis H-5 (now H-03), record: 'C-01 references H-03'

---

## STEP 5: Verify Completeness (MANDATORY)

Cross-check: For EVERY hypothesis in hypotheses.md AND every standalone finding ([VS-*], [BLIND-*], [SE-*], [EN-*], [SLITHER-*]) in findings_inventory.md:
- Is it assigned a report ID in the Master Finding Index above?
- If NO and NOT marked FALSE_POSITIVE by a verifier -> ASSIGN a report ID and tier

**HARD RULE**: The ONLY valid exclusion reasons are the conservative triage
statuses from Step 1.25, an explicit false-positive/refuted verifier verdict,
or an explicit duplicate/merge already listed with the absorbing report ID.
"Not grouped into a hypothesis" is NOT a valid exclusion reason.

---

## STEP 5.5: Promotion Coverage Audit (MANDATORY)

Before finalizing the index, produce an accounting receipt in
`report_coverage.md`. Keep this bounded: use `verification_queue.md`,
`verify_core.md`, `finding_mapping.md`, and the final Master Finding Index as
the coverage sources. Do NOT bulk-read raw breadth/depth/scanner artifacts in
this phase. Raw promotion checks are enforced mechanically by the Python gate;
the indexer owns the reportable verification-to-report mapping.

Coverage reasoning must preserve upstream semantics, not re-derive them. For each candidate, keep the broken invariant, branch precondition, terminal failure mechanism, verification disposition, and source IDs visible in the existing `Report ID / Refutation / Reason` free-text field when those details affect whether the candidate is promoted, duplicated, false-positive, or deferred. If a candidate is marked `DUPLICATE`, the reason must make clear that no distinct branch precondition or terminal mechanism was dropped; otherwise assign it a separate report ID or mark it with the correct non-duplicate status.

For each verification/finding-mapping candidate, assign one of:
- `PROMOTED`: mapped to a report ID
- `MERGED`: absorbed into an existing report ID with no semantic loss
- `APPENDIX_ONLY`: accounted in Excluded Findings but intentionally outside the body
- `DROP_FALSE_POSITIVE`: explicitly refuted by verifier/judge evidence
- `DROP_NON_SECURITY`: no security-relevant impact after verification
- `DROP_DESIGN_CONFIRMATION`: positive/safe/design-confirmation row, not a finding
- `DROP_UNACTIONABLE_SPECULATION`: no reachable path, impacted actor, or actionable fix
- `DUPLICATE`: absorbed into an existing report ID; use only when equivalent to `MERGED`
- `FALSE_POSITIVE`: legacy alias for `DROP_FALSE_POSITIVE`
- `DEFERRED`: hypothesis remains unproven, but must still appear in the ledger

### HARD RULES

1. A Medium+ candidate from verification_queue/finding_mapping MUST NOT disappear silently.
2. If a Medium+ candidate is not promoted, the ledger must name the absorbing report ID or the exact verifier/judge evidence supporting the non-body triage status.
3. If recon recommends a niche lane (for example `EVENT_COMPLETENESS`) and that lane did not run in the current mode, record the uncovered recommendation in the ledger as `DEFERRED: mode-limited`.
4. If a candidate appears in verification_queue/verify_core but not in
   `finding_mapping.md`, treat that as a promotion failure and either assign it
   a report ID or explicitly mark it duplicate / false positive / deferred with
   reasoning.
5. Do not use `DUPLICATE`, `MERGED`, `APPENDIX_ONLY`, or any `DROP_*` status as a convenience status when the candidate carries a distinct broken invariant, branch precondition, terminal mechanism, verification disposition, or source ID that is not retained by the absorbing report ID and ledger reason.

```

### CRITICAL FORMAT RULES for Master Finding Index

1. **Internal Hypothesis column MUST be the LAST column** — the downstream validator extracts the last matching ID per row.
2. **Do NOT include an Agent Sources column.** Agent source traceability belongs in `report_coverage.md`, not in the client-facing report.
3. **No parenthetical constituent IDs** — write `CH-3` or `H-2+H-13`, NOT `CH-3 (H-2, H-13)`.
4. **Consolidated rows may use `+`-joined IDs** — if one report finding intentionally absorbs multiple verified hypotheses, write the Internal Hypothesis cell as `H-2+H-13` and also list the same IDs in the Consolidation Map. Do not use comma prose or parentheticals. If a chain has its own verifier file (`verify_CH-3.md`), use `CH-3`; if only constituent verifier files exist, use the `+`-joined constituent IDs so downstream body writers can read every evidence file.
5. **Section headings must be EXACT** — use `## Master Finding Index` and `## Excluded Findings` exactly. Do NOT append suffixes.

---

## Also Write: Report Coverage Audit

Write to `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_coverage.md`:

```markdown
# Report Coverage Audit

## Raw Candidate Ledger
| Source File | Candidate ID / Label | Severity Signal | Status | Report ID / Refutation / Reason |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------|

## Uncovered Mode-Limited Recommendations
| Source | Recommended Lane | Why Not Run | Risk of Miss |
|--------|------------------|-------------|--------------|

## Promotion Failures Repaired
| Raw Source | Candidate | Action Taken |
|------------|----------|--------------|
```

---

## Terminal Stop Rule

After writing both `report_index.md` and `report_coverage.md`, stop immediately.
Do not reopen either output to polish it. Do not run another self-audit loop.
The Python driver owns post-write validation and will retry with a precise hint
if anything is still wrong.

Forbidden outputs in this phase:
- Do NOT write `report_critical_high.md` or `report_critical_high_*.md`.
- Do NOT write `report_medium.md` or `report_medium_*.md`.
- Do NOT write `report_low_info.md` or `report_low_info_*.md`.
- Do NOT write `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.

If you notice any of those files already exist, ignore them. They belong to
later subprocesses and are not part of your task.

---

## Step 6a.1: Completeness Verification (Orchestrator Inline)

After Index Agent returns, orchestrator performs this mechanical check:

1. Count hypothesis IDs in `{SCRATCHPAD}/hypotheses.md` (grep for `| H-`)
2. Count report IDs in `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md` Master Finding Index
3. Count excluded IDs in `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md` Excluded Findings
4. Count consolidated IDs (hypotheses absorbed into another report finding via STEP 1.5)
5. **ASSERT**: `hypothesis_count == report_ids + excluded_count + consolidated_absorbed_count`
6. If **MISMATCH**:
   - Diff ID sets to find missing hypotheses
   - Log: `"INDEX COMPLETENESS FAILURE: {missing_list}"`
   - Re-spawn Index Agent with: `"Assign report IDs to these missing hypotheses: {list}"`
   - Re-run this verification after re-spawn

Then verify `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_coverage.md` exists and has at least one ledger row for every depth/scanner artifact present in the scratchpad.

---

SCOPE: Write ONLY to `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_index.md` and `{SCRATCHPAD}/report_coverage.md`. Do NOT read or write tier report files. Do NOT proceed to tier writing, assembly, or any subsequent pipeline phase. Return and stop.
