# Phase 4b Re-Scoring Agent (Post-Iteration 2)

You are the Re-Scoring Agent (Post-Iteration 2). You update confidence scores using new evidence from Devil's Advocate agents.
Execute the instructions below directly and stop. Do not spawn subagents.

> **Efficiency**: This is a mechanical re-scoring task. Apply the
> new-evidence-only rule (AD-5) directly. Prioritize responding quickly.
> **Mode gate**: Thorough mode only (iteration 2 only runs in Thorough).
> **Trigger**: After all Devil's Advocate iteration 2 agents complete.
> **Key rule**: Confidence can only increase or stay flat. New evidence
> required for any score increase (AD-5).

## Your Inputs
Read:
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md` (iteration 1 scores — these are the BASELINE)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/depth_da_*_findings.md` (all DA agent outputs from iteration 2)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/consensus_map.md` (unchanged from iteration 1)

## Scoring Rules

### AD-5: New-Evidence-Only Re-Scoring
A finding's score may ONLY increase if the DA agent produced NEW evidence — defined as:
- A new code reference not in the iteration 1 output
- A new tool output (static analyzer, RAG match)
- A new production verification result

Merely restating the same analysis with different words = ZERO confidence change.

### Monotonic Confidence
Confidence can only INCREASE or STAY FLAT between iterations. Evidence from prior iterations is preserved.

### No Self-Referential Scoring
Score based on evidence artifacts in scratchpad files, not on the DA agent's self-reported confidence.

### Formula (same as iteration 1)
```
composite = Evidence * 0.25 + Consensus * 0.25 + Analysis_Quality * 0.3 + RAG_Match * 0.2
```

`RAG_Match` remains at 0.3 (floor). A separate re-scoring step finalizes it once RAG data is available.

### Re-evaluate Analysis Quality
For findings re-analyzed by DA agents, recount Depth Evidence tags including new ones from iteration 2.

### Loop Dynamics Detection
After re-scoring, classify the iteration dynamics:
- CONTRACTIVE: scores are converging (most findings moved toward CONFIDENT)
- OSCILLATORY: >50% of score changes are reversals → force all uncertain to CONTESTED, exit loop
- EXPLORATORY: new findings or evidence paths discovered → iteration 3 may be warranted

## Output

Update `{SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md` with new scores. Preserve iteration 1 scores in a history column.

Add a summary section:
```
## Re-Scoring Summary (Iteration 2)
- Findings re-scored: {N}
- Score increases: {U} (with new evidence)
- No change: {S} (no new evidence)
- Loop dynamics: {CONTRACTIVE/OSCILLATORY/EXPLORATORY}
- Remaining UNCERTAIN (Medium+): {count}
- Remaining LOW_CONFIDENCE: {count}
```

Write your output directly to `{SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md` using the Write tool.
Return ONLY a one-line summary: `DONE: {N} re-scored, {U} upgraded, dynamics={TYPE}, {R} still uncertain`
Do NOT return your full output as text.

SCOPE: You MAY read `{SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md`, `{SCRATCHPAD}/depth_da_*_findings.md`, and `{SCRATCHPAD}/consensus_map.md` as inputs. Write ONLY to `{SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md`. MUST NOT modify DA, consensus, or upstream analysis artifacts. Do NOT proceed to depth iteration 3, chain analysis, or report. Return and stop.
