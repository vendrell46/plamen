# Phase 5: L1 Verification (Shard-Local Model)

> **Audience**: V2 driver subprocess running a verify shard for L1 infrastructure audits.
> **Architecture**: Inline shard-local verification — no nested subagents.
> **Excludes**: all downstream verification review, consistency, aggregate, and report phases.
> **Isolation**: Downstream Step 5 sub-phases intentionally withheld from this shard prompt.

## Verification Model

Read only the shard manifest named in the driver prefix for this phase. Do not
open other shard manifests.

Process the assigned rows directly in the current phase agent. Do NOT spawn one
subagent per finding. Prior L1 runs showed that nested verifier swarms dominate
usage and do not improve promotion quality compared with bounded shard-local
verification.

The driver uses severity-aware bounded shards and runs every verify shard on
Sonnet: Critical/High target ~8 rows, Medium target ~12 rows, Low/Info target
~18 rows. Empty shard slots are skipped by the driver, so this does not add
cost on smaller audits.

## Bug-Class Routing Table

| Bug class | Preferred evidence tag |
|---|---|
| Fork-diff / cross-env | `[DIFF-PASS]` |
| Non-determinism | `[NON-DET-PASS]` |
| Consensus invariant | `[CONFORMANCE-PASS]` |
| Network DoS | `[FUZZ-PASS]` |
| Light-client proof | `[CONFORMANCE-PASS]` |
| RPC / execution | `[POC-PASS]` |
| BLS / crypto | `[CONFORMANCE-PASS]` |
| SCIP-backed trace | `[LSP-TRACE]` |
| Fallback (no mechanical path) | `[CODE-TRACE]` |

### Evidence Tag Definitions

| Tag | Meaning | Weight |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `[DIFF-PASS]` | Cross-client or fork-diff comparison confirms behavioral divergence | Mechanical proof |
| `[CONFORMANCE-PASS]` | Verified against protocol specification or formal invariant | Mechanical proof |
| `[NON-DET-PASS]` | Demonstrated non-deterministic execution under controlled conditions | Mechanical proof |
| `[FUZZ-PASS]` | Fuzzer found a triggering input or resource exhaustion path | Mechanical proof |
| `[LSP-TRACE]` | SCIP index citation proving call graph / data flow path | Strong trace (requires scip/ citation) |
| `[POC-PASS]` | Compiled, executed, assertions PASSED | Mechanical proof |
| `[CODE-TRACE]` | Manual trace with concrete values, no execution | Fallible — caps at CONTESTED |

## Verifier row template

For each assigned finding in the shard manifest, execute verification inline using
this template:

```
Phase 5 Verifier for {FINDING_ID}: {TITLE}
Location: {LOCATION} | Bug class: {CLASS} | Preferred tag: {TAG} | Primary Artifact: {PRIMARY_ARTIFACT}
PoC Class: {POC_CLASS} | Optional test infrastructure: {SCRATCHPAD}/test_infrastructure.md
Produce mechanical verification per preferred workflow. If it fails, try one variant before
falling back to [LSP-TRACE] (requires scip/ citation) or [CODE-TRACE] (caps at CONTESTED).
Read ONLY:
1. your row in `{SCRATCHPAD}/verification_queue.md`
2. the exact source file(s) at `{LOCATION}`
3. `{SCRATCHPAD}/{PRIMARY_ARTIFACT}`
4. one relevant `scip/*.md` helper or build artifact if the preferred workflow requires it
5. `{SCRATCHPAD}/test_infrastructure.md` ONLY IF IT EXISTS (for poc_class:
   unit|property — use constructors and patterns; if absent, inspect the
   project test files/build system directly)
Do NOT read unrelated verifier files, unrelated depth artifacts, or the full
`findings_inventory.md` unless `{PRIMARY_ARTIFACT}` is missing.
Write ONLY `{SCRATCHPAD}/verify_{FINDING_ID}.md`. Do NOT write
later-phase report, consistency, aggregate, or review artifacts. Those are
produced in dedicated subsequent phases that the V2 driver runs separately.
Inline writes from a verify shard are quarantined to `_overflow/`
automatically (v2.1.8) but recurring violations indicate methodology drift;
respect the phase boundary.
Write your result to {SCRATCHPAD}/verify_{FINDING_ID}.md per section WRITE-THEN-VERIFY.
Return ONLY: "DONE: {FINDING_ID} verdict={VERDICT} tag={TAG}"
```

---

## Output File Schema

Each `verify_{FINDING_ID}.md` MUST contain:

```markdown
# Verification: {FINDING_ID}

**Preferred Tag**: {TAG from queue row}
**Evidence Tag**: {ACTUAL_TAG_USED}
**Verdict**: CONFIRMED / REFUTED / CONTESTED / INFEASIBLE / FALSE_POSITIVE

## Execution Output
{Mechanical evidence: diff output, test output, SCIP citation, or code trace}

## Suggested Fix
{If CONFIRMED — minimal diff-style fix. Omit if REFUTED/FALSE_POSITIVE.}
```

**Schema rules**:
- Missing `Preferred Tag:` line is a schema failure.
- `Evidence Tag` must be one of the 7 tags from the routing table above.
- If the preferred tag workflow fails and fallback is used, document why in Execution Output.

## Fallback Ladder

When the preferred verification workflow fails:

1. **Preferred tag workflow** — attempt first per bug-class routing table
2. **One variant** — relax one dimension (timing, amount, ordering, initial state) and retry
3. **`[LSP-TRACE]`** — requires a concrete `scip/*.md` citation proving the call graph or data flow path. Stronger than CODE-TRACE but not mechanical proof.
4. **`[CODE-TRACE]`** — manual trace with concrete values substituted. Caps verdict at CONTESTED unless the trace is complete with real constants from the codebase.

Do NOT retry the same workflow more than once. Move down the ladder.

## Scope Containment

SCOPE: Verify ONLY findings assigned to this shard. Write each finding's file, then continue to
the next assigned row. After all assigned rows are written, return and stop.

Do NOT:
- Read or write other shards' verify files
- Write artifacts outside the verify_<ID>.md contract
- Spawn nested subagents
