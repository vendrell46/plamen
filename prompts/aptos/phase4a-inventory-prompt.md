# Phase 4a: Inventory Agent Prompt Template -- Aptos Move

> **Usage**: Orchestrator reads this file and spawns the Inventory Agent with this prompt.
> Replace placeholders `{SCRATCHPAD}`, `{list...}`, etc. with actual values.
> **Includes**: Side Effect Trace audit (merged from Phase 3.5 to eliminate a sequential gate).
> **Note**: Confidence scoring is computed by the orchestrator's scoring agent AFTER Phase 4b iteration 1, not during inventory. The inventory agent's job is unchanged -- it inventories findings and prepares depth candidates.

## Inventory Agent

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="
You are the Inventory Agent for an Aptos Move module audit.

Read ALL files matching {SCRATCHPAD}/analysis_*.md

For each file:
- Extract all findings and DEPTH_TARGETS
- Extract Step Execution fields -- flag findings with X or ? without valid reasons
- Extract Rules Applied field -- flag missing rule applications (R1-R17, MR1-MR5, AR1-AR4)

## TASK 1: Findings Inventory

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Findings Inventory
**Total: {N} findings from {M} agents**
| # | Finding ID | Agent | Severity | Location | Title | Verdict | Step Execution | Rules Applied | RAG Confidence |

## Chain Summary
| Finding ID | Location | Root Cause (1-line) | Verdict | Severity | Precondition Type | Postcondition Type |
|------------|----------|--------------------:|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|

## REFUTED Findings (for Depth Second Opinion)
| Finding ID | Agent | Reason for REFUTED | Missing Precondition | Domain |

## CONTESTED Findings (for Depth Priority)
| Finding ID | Agent | External Dep Involved | Worst-Case Severity | Notes |

## Incomplete Analysis Flags
| Finding ID | Missing Steps | Reason Invalid? | Flag for Depth? |

## Rule Application Violations
| Finding ID | Rule | Expected | Actual | Violation? |

Check these rules -- BOTH standard and Aptos-specific:

**Standard rule checks (R1-R17)**:
- R6 (Bidirectional Role): If SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLE detected AND finding involves role -> both directions required
- R8 (Cached Params): If multi-step operation or stored external state detected -> staleness check required
- R10 (Worst-State): If severity uses current on-chain state -> flag for recalibration
- R14 (Constraint Coherence + Setter Regression): If admin setter modifies limit/bound -> regression check and coherence check required

**Move-specific rule checks (MR1-MR5)**:
- MR1 (Ability Analysis): If struct with value semantics detected (tokens, receipts, capabilities) -> ability audit required (check for `copy` on value types, `drop` on obligation types, `store` on capability types)
- MR2 (Bit-Shift Safety): If `<<` or `>>` operation detected -> bounds check required (Move aborts on shift >= bit width)
- MR3 (Type Safety): If generic type parameter in public function -> type constraint check required
- MR4 (Dependency Audit): If third-party module dependency detected -> upgrade risk and trust assessment required
- MR5 (Visibility Audit): If `public` function modifies sensitive state -> minimum visibility check required

**Aptos-specific rule checks (AR1-AR4)**:
- AR1 (Ref Lifecycle): If ConstructorRef, TransferRef, MintRef, BurnRef, DeleteRef, or ExtendRef detected -> lifecycle audit required (storage security, access control, extraction risk)
- AR2 (FA Compliance): If FungibleAsset or FungibleStore operations detected -> metadata validation and dispatchable hook safety required
- AR3 (Reentrancy): If dispatchable hooks detected OR dynamic dispatch via cross-module calls with mutable borrows -> reentrancy check required (checks-effects-interactions pattern for Move)
- AR4 (Randomness Safety): If `randomness` module usage detected -> entry-only constraint and test-and-abort prevention required

## TASK 1.5: Assumption Dependency Cross-Reference

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/design_context.md -- specifically the Trust Assumption Table.

For each finding in the Findings Inventory above, identify the actor required to execute the attack path, then cross-reference against the Trust Assumption Table:

| Condition | Tag | Severity Effect |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Attack requires `FULLY_TRUSTED` actor to act maliciously | `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: TRUSTED-ACTOR]` | -1 tier (applied by Index Agent) |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor to act maliciously | No tag | No change -- severity matrix Likelihood axis already captures "specific conditions/complex setup" |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor to act WITHIN stated bounds | `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: WITHIN-BOUNDS]` | Flag only -- no severity change |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor to EXCEED stated bounds | No tag | Real finding -- no change |
| Attack requires `UNTRUSTED` actor or exploits `PRECONDITION` violation | No tag | Real finding -- no change |

**Rules**:
- `TRUSTED-ACTOR` tag is ONLY for `FULLY_TRUSTED` actors (e.g., governance multisig, DAO, timelock). NEVER tag `SEMI_TRUSTED` actors as `TRUSTED-ACTOR` -- their findings are calibrated through the severity matrix Likelihood axis instead.
- Only tag if the finding's ENTIRE attack path depends on the assumption. If the attack has BOTH a trusted-actor path AND an untrusted-actor path -> no tag.
- `WITHIN-BOUNDS` means the attack's impact does not exceed what the stated bounds already allow. If the finding shows impact BEYOND stated bounds -> no tag (real bug).
- When uncertain whether impact exceeds bounds -> do NOT tag. Err on the side of preserving severity.

| Finding ID | Attack Actor | Actor Trust Level | Within Bounds? | Tag | Original Severity |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-----|-------------------|

## Static Analysis Finding Promotion

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/static_analysis.md (contains Move Prover results, compiler diagnostics, and grep-based static detector results)

### Move Prover Spec Violations
For each Move Prover verification failure:
- Read the spec violation description and the function it applies to
- Cross-reference against existing findings -- is this violation already covered?
- If NOT covered: create hypothesis with severity based on the spec's intent:
  - Arithmetic spec failure (overflow, underflow, bounds) -> MEDIUM
  - Invariant violation (resource consistency, balance tracking) -> HIGH
  - Pre/post-condition failure (function contract violation) -> MEDIUM
- Add with [PROVER-N] IDs

### Unsafe Ability Usage
From static_analysis.md Ability Analysis section:
- `copy` on value-bearing structs (tokens, receipts, capabilities) -> Create ability duplication hypothesis (HIGH -- value created from nothing)
- `drop` on obligation structs (hot potatoes, flash loan receipts) -> Create obligation bypass hypothesis (HIGH -- obligations silently discarded)
- `store` on capability structs without access control -> Create capability extraction hypothesis (MEDIUM -- capability can be moved to attacker-controlled storage)
- Add with [ABILITY-N] IDs

### Bit-Shift Without Bounds Check
From static_analysis.md Arithmetic Analysis section:
- Any `<<` or `>>` operation where the shift amount is derived from user input or computed from state WITHOUT bounds checking -> Create bit-shift abort hypothesis (HIGH priority given Cetus exploit -- DoS via runtime abort)
- Add with [SHIFT-N] IDs

### Reference Lifecycle Leaks
From static_analysis.md Reference Lifecycle Analysis section:
- ConstructorRef stored in global storage -> Create ref leak hypothesis (CRITICAL -- unlimited new refs can be generated)
- MintRef/BurnRef/TransferRef returned from public function or stored in globally accessible resource -> Create ref leak hypothesis (HIGH -- unauthorized token operations)
- ExtendRef accessible without proper gating -> Create signer escalation hypothesis (HIGH -- object signer can be generated)
- Add with [REF-N] IDs

### Reentrancy Risk
From static_analysis.md Reentrancy Analysis section:
- `borrow_global_mut` held across a cross-module function call -> Create reentrancy hypothesis (MEDIUM -- state corruption if callback occurs)
- Add with [REENT-N] IDs

### Ungated Transfer Risk
From static_analysis.md Object Transfer Analysis section:
- Sensitive objects with ungated transfer enabled -> Create object theft hypothesis (severity depends on object contents)
- Add with [XFER-N] IDs

Add ALL promoted findings to inventory with their respective IDs and Severity: Medium (pending verification), unless specific severity noted above.

---

## TASK 2: Side Effect Trace Audit

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md (Token Account Mapping and Reference Lifecycle Tracking sections).

For EACH cross-module call where the target module may modify global storage or produce side effects:

### Module Call Side Effect Trace Template

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | What function makes this cross-module call? | {module}:{function}:{line} |
| 2 | What side effects can the cross-module call produce? | {list all: resource mutations, token transfers, event emissions, dispatchable hook triggers, object transfers} |
| 3a | What RESOURCE TYPES does each side effect modify? | {specific resource, e.g., FungibleStore, CoinStore, user position resource} |
| 3b | Where does that modification LAND? | {resource address: module resource account, user address, object address} |
| 3c | What code paths CONSUME that modified state? | {list all functions that read the modified resource via borrow_global or balance queries} |
| 3d | Does the consuming code HANDLE this specific modification? | YES (it accounts for it) / NO (it ignores or mishandles it) / UNKNOWN |
| 3e | Does the side effect ADD ENTRIES to any iterated collection? | YES (new SmartVector entry, new Table entry, new SimpleMap entry) / NO |
| 3f | Is there a CLEANUP PATH for state created by this side effect? | {function name for removal/cleanup} / NONE |
| 3g | Can a dispatchable hook ABORT to manipulate caller state? | Check: Does the caller branch on the result? Does an abort here skip state updates the caller assumes happened? If the module calls `dispatchable_fungible_asset::withdraw` and the hook aborts, does the calling function leave state in an inconsistent state? |

### Trace Termination
Continue tracing until ONE of:
- The side effect state exits the protocol (transferred out to user/external) -> SAFE
- The state is consumed by protocol logic correctly (accounted for) -> SAFE
- The state is STRANDED (no cleanup path, no accounting) -> **FINDING**
- The state corrupts accounting (consumed by wrong logic) -> **FINDING**
- The side effect creates unbounded collection growth -> **FINDING**
- The dispatchable hook abort leaves caller state inconsistent -> **FINDING**

### Cross-Reference with Breadth
For each trace, check if breadth agents already identified a finding covering this path:
- If YES: note 'Covered by [XX-N]' and verify the breadth finding traced to the SAME termination point
- If NO: this is a NEW gap -- create finding [SE-N]

### Side Effect Trace Output
Append to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Side Effect Trace Audit
### Module Call Side Effect Trace Summary
| # | Cross-Module Call | Side Effect | Resource Modified | Landing Address | Consuming Code | Handled? | Breadth Coverage | Finding |
|---|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|------------------|---------|

### Side Effect Findings (if any)
Use finding IDs [SE-1], [SE-2], etc. with standard finding format.

### Side Effect Coverage Gaps
List any cross-module calls with UNKNOWN side effects that could not be resolved without production verification.

## TASK 3: Elevated Signal Audit

Read `{SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md` and extract all `[ELEVATE]` tags.

For each `[ELEVATE]` tag:

| # | Signal | Tag Type | Addressed by Finding? | Finding ID | If Not Addressed |
|---|--------|----------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | {signal text} | {tag type} | YES/NO | {ID or NONE} | Flag for depth |

**Rules**:
- Every `[ELEVATE]` tag MUST be explicitly addressed -- either covered by an existing finding or flagged for depth review
- If NO finding addresses the signal -> add to `depth_candidates.md` as HIGH priority investigation target
- 'Addressed' means a finding explicitly analyzed the risk described by the signal, not just mentioned the same code location

Append to `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md`:

## Elevated Signal Audit
| Signal | Tag | Addressed? | Finding ID / Depth Flag |

---

## TASK 4: Depth Candidates

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/depth_candidates.md:
## Depth Candidates
Categorize ALL findings by depth domain:
- Token Flow: FungibleAsset/Coin flows, FungibleStore creation, dispatchable hooks, unsolicited deposits, metadata validation, Coin-to-FA accounting parity
- State Trace: Global storage invariants, resource lifecycle, module reentrancy paths, ref leaks, cross-module state, cross-resource consistency
- Edge Case: Zero-state, first depositor, bit-shift boundaries, zero-value FungibleAsset, ability edge cases, initialization ordering, CU/gas limits
- External: External module calls, upgrade risk, dispatchable hooks from external modules, dependency trust

## Second Opinion Targets
List ALL REFUTED findings that depth agents MUST re-evaluate:
| Finding ID | Domain | Breadth Reasoning | Potential Enablers |

## TASK 4.5: Quick Chain Pre-Scan (Dependency-Aware Severity)

For each finding with Severity=Low AND a non-empty Postcondition Type in the Chain Summary:

1. Search ALL findings with Severity >= Medium that have a Missing Precondition matching this Low finding's Postcondition Type
2. If MATCH FOUND (same type AND compatible description):
   - Tag the Low finding as `CHAIN_ESCALATED: enables {Medium+ finding ID}`
   - Set `effective_severity = Medium` (for depth budget allocation ONLY -- reported severity unchanged)
3. Write escalated findings to depth_candidates.md under '## Chain-Escalated Findings'

| Low Finding | Postcondition | Matching Medium+ Finding | Missing Precondition | Escalation |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------|

**HARD RULE**: This does NOT change the finding's actual severity. It only affects depth budget priority. The chain analysis agent (Phase 4c) determines final severity.

**Cap**: Maximum 5 escalations per audit. If more than 5 match, prioritize by the highest severity of the matching Medium+ finding.

## TASK 5: State Dependency Cross-Reference

Using `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_variables.md` and `{SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md`, build a cross-function dependency map via shared state.

For each resource field written by function A and read/depended-on by function B (where A ≠ B and A is public):
- Can A put the resource in a state that breaks B's assumption?

Write to `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_dependency_map.md`:

| Variable | Writer Function | Consumer Function | Can Writer Break Consumer? |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|

**Rules**:
- Cap at 30 rows. Prioritize: public entry writers first, critical consumers (settlement, withdrawal, claim, liquidation) first
- Omit trivially safe pairs (both require the same signer AND the writer cannot set an invalid value)
- The "Can Writer Break Consumer?" column is a YES/NO with a 1-phrase reason. YES entries become depth agent investigation targets
- Filter: different functions only (self-reads are not cross-function conflicts)

---

## Skip Depth? (RARE)
Depth skips ONLY if ALL conditions met:
- [ ] 0 REFUTED findings
- [ ] 0 PARTIAL findings
- [ ] 0 CONTESTED findings
- [ ] 0 findings with incomplete step execution
- [ ] 0 rule application violations
- [ ] 0 promoted static analysis findings (Prover, Ability, Shift, Ref, Reentrancy, Transfer)
- [ ] All findings have RAG confidence > 0.8
- [ ] No UNVERIFIED external module deps
- [ ] 0 side effect coverage gaps

If ANY checkbox unchecked -> SPAWN ALL DEPTH AGENTS

---

## Gate File Output (MANDATORY)

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/phase4_gates.md:

# Phase 4 Gate Status

## Gate 1: Spawn Verification
- **BINDING MANIFEST checked**: YES/NO
- **Missing required agents**: [list or NONE]
- **Status**: BLOCKED if missing > 0, else OPEN

## Side Effect Trace Status
- **Cross-module calls with side effects**: {count}
- **Fully traced**: {count}
- **New [SE-N] findings**: {count}
- **Coverage gaps (UNKNOWN)**: {count}

## Proceed to Step 4b?
- Gate 1: {OPEN/BLOCKED}
- **Decision**: PROCEED if OPEN, else RE-SPAWN MISSING AGENTS FIRST

> **Note**: After Phase 4b iteration 1 completes, the orchestrator will run a scoring agent to compute confidence scores for all findings. This scoring step is handled by the orchestrator's adaptive loop, not by the inventory agent.

Return: 'DONE: {N} findings inventoried, {M} REFUTED for second opinion, {K} CONTESTED, {J} static promoted (Prover:{P} Ability:{A} Shift:{S} Ref:{R} Reentrancy:{RE} Transfer:{T}), {SE} side effects traced ({SE_NEW} new findings), gate: {status}, depth: MANDATORY/SKIP'
")
```
