# Phase 4b: Adaptive Depth Loop -- Aptos Move

> **Usage**: Orchestrator reads this file and runs the Adaptive Depth Loop for Aptos Move audits.
> Iteration 1 spawns ALL 8 agents (4 depth + 3 blind spot + 1 validation sweep). Iterations 2-3 are targeted and autonomous.
> Replace placeholders `{SCRATCHPAD}`, `{TYPE}`, etc. with actual values.

---

## Orchestrator: Autonomous Adaptive Depth Loop

> **Coverage-first design**: Iteration 1 ALWAYS spawns all 8 agents.
> Iterations 2-3 are targeted, autonomous, and anti-dilution protected.
> **The orchestrator runs the ENTIRE loop without user intervention.**
> Timeout-aware split-and-retry, severity-weighted budget, dynamic cap, loop dynamics detection, post-verification error trace feedback.
> **Reference**: `~/.claude/rules/phase4-confidence-scoring.md` for scoring model and anti-dilution rules.

  // Niche agents write to {SCRATCHPAD}/niche_{name}_findings.md
  //
  // â•â•â• MODEL DIVERSITY â•â•â•

  //   depth-edge-case: sonnet  (pattern-matching - boundary values, zero state)
  //   depth-external: sonnet   (pattern-matching - external call effects)
  //   Blind Spot Scanner A: sonnet, Scanner B: sonnet, Scanner C: sonnet
  //   Validation Sweep: sonnet
  //   Niche agents: sonnet
  // Rationale: Same-model agents have correlated attention patterns. Mixing opus/sonnet
  // increases decorrelation (CodeX-Verify: +39.7pp accuracy from low-correlation aggregation).
  // Cost impact: swapping 2 opusâ†’sonnet is cost-neutral or savings.

  // â•â•â• DEPTH INPUT FILTERING â•â•â•
  // Each depth agent reads ONLY findings from its domain (from consensus_map.md)
  // This prevents context dilution: a token-flow agent should not read state-trace findings

  //   depth-token-flow: findings tagged token-flow, balance, transfer, mint/burn
  //   depth-state-trace: findings tagged state-trace, accumulator, invariant, sync
  //   depth-edge-case: findings tagged edge-case, boundary, zero-state, overflow
  //   depth-external: findings tagged external, oracle, cross-chain, CPI/cross-module

### Exit Conditions Summary

| Condition | When | Effect |
|-----------|------|--------|
| All CONFIDENT | 0 findings < 0.7 | Exit immediately |
| Budget exhausted | depth_spawns_used â‰¥ max_depth_spawns | Exit, accept current scores |
| No progress | No new evidence in iteration 2 or 3 | Force CONTESTED on uncertain, exit |
| OSCILLATORY | >50% score changes are reversals after iteration 2 | Force CONTESTED on uncertain, exit |
| Max iterations | 3 iterations completed | Force CONTESTED on < 0.4, exit |
| DST Reserved | Always at DONE | Spawn Design Stress agent (1 pre-allocated slot), then proceed |
| POST_VERIFICATION_FEEDBACK | Error traces from Phase 5 + remaining budget | Additional targeted depth, then exit |

**CRITICAL**: "No progress" can ONLY trigger after iteration 2, never after iteration 1. Iteration 2 is always mandatory when uncertain findings exist. "No progress" means the iteration produced zero new evidence items - not that the scoring formula can't improve.

## Scoring Pipeline

> **Spawn after**: Each iteration of the depth loop.
> **Model**: Always sonnet (formula application with per-finding differentiation).
> Pre-compute consensus inline, then batch findings for parallel scoring to prevent single-agent overload on large audits.

### Pre-Score: Consensus Pre-Computation (Orchestrator Inline)

Before spawning scoring agents, orchestrator produces `{SCRATCHPAD}/consensus_map.md`:
1. Read `findings_inventory.md` - extract each finding's ID, Location, Agent source
2. Group by Location (module.move:Line range). For each group:
   - Agents flagging = unique agents with finding at this location
   - Agents covering = agents whose domain scope includes this module
   - Consensus = flagging / covering (cap at 1.0; +0.2 if specialized agent, cap 1.0)
3. Write table: `| Finding ID | Agents Flagging | Agents Covering | Consensus Score | Specialized? |`

### Batch Scoring

Split all findings into domain batches of â‰¤15 findings each (token-flow, state-trace, edge-case, external, access-control, misc).
Spawn parallel sonnet scoring agents per batch. Each receives:
- Its batch of findings ONLY (extracted from source files)
- `{SCRATCHPAD}/consensus_map.md` (pre-computed Axis 2, shared across all batches)
- Scoring formula (unchanged - Axes 1,3,4 from finding data; Axis 2 from consensus_map)

After all return: merge `confidence_scores_batch_*.md` into `confidence_scores.md`.

### Scoring Agent Template (per batch)

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", prompt="
You are the Confidence Scoring Agent (Batch: {DOMAIN}). You compute confidence scores for a batch of Aptos Move audit findings using a fixed formula.

## Your Inputs
Read:
- {SCRATCHPAD}/consensus_map.md (pre-computed Axis 2 scores for ALL findings)
- Your batch of findings extracted from the relevant source files (provided below)
{IF ITERATION 2+: - {SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md (previous scores - for monotonic check)}

## Your Batch
{PASTE FINDING DATA FOR THIS BATCH - max 15 findings, extracted from findings_inventory.md + depth/blind_spot/validation files}

## Your Task

For EACH finding in your batch, compute 4 axis scores:

### Axis 1: Evidence (0.0—1.0)
Use the BEST evidence tag found for this finding:
- [PROD-ONCHAIN] = 1.0
- [PROD-SOURCE] = 0.9
- [PROD-FORK] = 0.9
- [CODE] = 0.8
- [DOC] = 0.4
- [MOCK] = 0.2
- [EXT-UNV] = 0.1
- No tag / unclear = 0.3
If finding has no explicit evidence tags, infer: code snippets from source = [CODE] = 0.8.

### Axis 2: Consensus (0.0—1.0)
Read from `{SCRATCHPAD}/consensus_map.md` - use the pre-computed score for each finding ID.
(Pre-computed by orchestrator: domain-aware agreement with specialized agent bonus.)

### Axis 3: Analysis Quality (0.0—1.0) - DUAL MODE

**Mode A - Depth agent findings** (finding ID starts with [DEPTH-*], [BLIND-*], or [VS-*]):
Count Depth Evidence tags ([BOUNDARY:*], [VARIATION:*], [TRACE:*]):
- 0 tags = 0.1
- 1 tag = 0.4
- 2 tags = 0.7
- 3+ tags = 1.0

**Mode B - All other findings** (breadth agents, chain findings, enabler findings):
From Step Execution field:
- Count steps marked ✓ or ✗(valid reason) as COMPLETE
- Count steps marked ✗(no reason) or ? as INCOMPLETE
- Score = COMPLETE / (COMPLETE + INCOMPLETE)
If no Step Execution field: score = 0.3

### Axis 4: RAG Match (0.0—1.0)
If finding has RAG validation result: use RAG confidence / 10
If no RAG validation: score = 0.3 (floor - missing RAG is a coverage gap, not negative evidence)

### Composite Score
composite = Evidence Ã— 0.25 + Consensus Ã— 0.25 + Analysis_Quality Ã— 0.3 + RAG_Match Ã— 0.2

### Classification
- composite â‰¥ 0.7: CONFIDENT
- 0.4 â‰¤ composite < 0.7: UNCERTAIN
- composite < 0.4: LOW_CONFIDENCE

{IF ITERATION 2+ WITH require_new_evidence=true:
### Monotonic Check
For each finding that existed in the previous confidence_scores.md:
- If this iteration's agent produced NEW evidence (new code ref, new tool output, new RAG match not in previous iteration): allow score increase
- If NO new evidence: keep previous score (do not increase)
- Score can NEVER decrease
}

### Per-Finding Differentiation (MANDATORY)
Each finding's composite MUST be computed from its individual evidence tags, consensus map entry, and analysis quality indicators. If two findings have different evidence profiles, their composites MUST differ. Identical composites for 4+ consecutive findings indicates formulaic stub scoring — re-read each finding's actual data before continuing.

## Output

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/confidence_scores.md:

| Finding ID | Evidence | Consensus | Analysis Quality | RAG Match | Composite | Classification | Domain |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| [XX-1] | 0.8 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 0.59 | UNCERTAIN | token-flow |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Summary
- CONFIDENT (â‰¥0.7): {N} findings
- UNCERTAIN (0.4-0.7): {M} findings
- LOW_CONFIDENCE (<0.4): {K} findings
- Total: {N+M+K} findings scored

Return: 'DONE: {total} findings scored - {N} CONFIDENT, {M} UNCERTAIN, {K} LOW_CONFIDENCE'
")
```

## MCP Soft Redirect

After iteration 1 scoring, the orchestrator checks for systematic RAG failure:

**Detection**: If `confidence_scores.md` shows RAG_Match axis = 0.3 (floor) for > 80% of findings:
1. Log to `adaptive_loop_log.md`: "MCP RAG FLOOR DETECTED - {N}% of findings at 0.3 floor"
2. For each UNCERTAIN finding, generate a targeted manual investigation question based on:
   - Fork ancestry patterns from `meta_buffer.md` (e.g., "Thala first-deposit manipulation: does this vault handle zero-share edge case?")
   - Protocol type common vulnerabilities (e.g., "vault: trace share price after fee harvest + loss event")
   - Attack surface signals tagged [ELEVATE] (see recon signal elevation)
3. Add these questions to the `depth_candidates.md` as `[RAG-COMPENSATE]` investigation targets
4. Iteration 2+ depth agents receive these as additional investigation questions (compatible with AD-1 evidence-only format)

**NOT a hard gate**: Pipeline continues normally. The redirect adds investigation breadth to compensate for missing historical pattern matching.

---

## Iteration 2+ Depth Agent Input Template (ANTI-DILUTION)

> **Purpose**: Clean finding cards for iteration 2-3 depth agents. Evidence only, no prior reasoning.
> **Anti-dilution rules**: AD-1 (evidence-only), AD-2 (no reasoning contamination), AD-3 (max 5), AD-4 (fresh tools), AD-5 (new evidence only).

> Iteration 2+ agents receive 1-3 findings (micro-niche) instead of up to 5. This maximizes per-finding depth and prevents the attention regression observed when broad agents receive too many findings.

For each iteration 2+ depth agent, use this prompt structure:

```
Task(subagent_type="depth-{type}", prompt="
You are the {TYPE} Devil's Advocate Depth Agent - ITERATION {N} (targeted pass) for an Aptos Move module audit.

**YOUR ROLE**: You are the Devil's Advocate. Your PRIMARY job is to find what the previous analysis MISSED - not to re-confirm what it found. For each finding:
- Read the 'Prior Path' field to understand what was already explored. Your job is to explore what was NOT.
- For each prior conclusion: ask 'what adjacent bug does this analysis OBSCURE?' What is the OPPOSITE interpretation of the same code?
- You MUST produce at least one finding or observation that CONTRADICTS or EXTENDS the previous analysis. If you agree with everything, you have not done your job.
- Make your OWN MCP tool calls. Produce NEW evidence that was not in iteration 1.

## Your Inputs

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md and the source files referenced below.
Do NOT read prior depth agent output files (depth_*_findings.md from iteration 1).

## Findings to Investigate

{FOR EACH FINDING (max 5, lowest confidence first):}

### Finding [XX-N]: {Title}
- **Location**: {module.move:L45-L67}
- **Evidence**: {[CODE] - relevant code snippet at L45}
- **Confidence**: {0.35}
- **Evidence Gap**: {What specific evidence is missing}
- **Prior Path**: {1-2 sentence summary of what the previous agent explored and how - NOT what it concluded. E.g., "Traced ability constraints on store; did not explore cross-module ref lifecycle or dispatchable hook reentry."}
- **Investigate**: {Focused question - e.g., 'Can set_max_capacity() be called with value below current count? Trace what happens to the while loop at L120 - does Move underflow abort trigger?'}

{END FOR EACH}

## MANDATORY DEPTH DIRECTIVE
For EVERY finding you re-analyze, apply at least 2 of these 3 techniques:
1. **Boundary Substitution**: Substitute boundary values into expressions. Tag: `[BOUNDARY:X=val â†’ outcome]`
   Aptos examples: `[BOUNDARY:shift_amount=64 for u64 â†’ runtime abort]`, `[BOUNDARY:fa_amount=0 â†’ zero() path]`
2. **Parameter Variation**: Vary inputs across valid range. Tag: `[VARIATION:param Aâ†’B â†’ outcome]`
   Aptos examples: `[VARIATION:upgrade_policy compatibleâ†’immutable â†’ signatures locked]`, `[VARIATION:fa_metadata standardâ†’custom_hooks â†’ reentrancy]`
3. **Trace to Termination**: Follow execution to terminal state. When a boundary value produces weight=0, contribution=0, or amount=0 in a computation, trace whether the zero-value entry still INCREMENTS a counter or PASSES a gate that downstream code relies on for correctness. **Nested call resolution**: When tracing an extraction path through an inner function (e.g., cross-module call, dispatchable hook), also trace what happens when control returns to the OUTER calling function - does it perform a post-execution state check (balance comparison, resource field delta, assert!) that atomically reverts the entire transaction if the extraction exceeds bounds? Tag: `[TRACE:pathâ†’outcome at L{N}]`

## Your Task

For EACH finding above:
1. Read the source code at the specified location YOURSELF
2. Make your OWN MCP tool calls:
   - Use Read/Grep tools for the relevant functions
   - validate_hypothesis() for RAG validation
   - search_solodit_live() if local results < 5
3. Answer the investigation question with NEW evidence
4. Produce a verdict: CONFIRMED / PARTIAL / REFUTED / CONTESTED
5. If you discover a NEW attack path not described in the finding card: document it as [DEPTH-{TYPE}-IT{N}-M]

## Output
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/depth_{type}_iteration{N}_findings.md:
- Per-finding analysis with NEW evidence (tag all evidence sources)
- Updated verdicts (with justification from YOUR analysis, not prior agents)
- Any new findings discovered

Return: 'DONE: {N} findings re-analyzed, {M} new evidence items, {K} verdict changes, {J} new findings'
