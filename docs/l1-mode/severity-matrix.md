# L1 Mode Severity Matrix

> **Version**: v0.2 — Immunefi verbatim integration
> **Scope**: All findings produced by `/plamen l1` mode
> **Reference**: Aligned with [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System v2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/) for Blockchain/DLT infrastructure.

## Why a new matrix

The smart-contract severity matrix in `rules/report-template.md` is built around impact categories like "direct fund loss" and "protocol breakage" that translate poorly to L1 infrastructure. An L1 node-client bug can produce consequences that are not in the DeFi vocabulary: a full network halt, a chain fork, an eclipse, a finality delay, a light-client bypass, a state sync poisoning. This matrix maps those consequences into Plamen's Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info tiers consistently.

L1 mode findings are graded by this matrix; smart-contract findings (including any DeFi contracts running on the L1 under audit) continue to use `report-template.md`.

## Impact categories

| Impact tier | Definition | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Network cannot confirm new transactions; unintended chain split; direct loss of user funds via protocol-level mechanism; permanent freeze of >10% of staked funds; consensus failure leading to unrecoverable state | Consensus halt from non-determinism; successful double-spend via fork-choice flaw; crafted payload triggering divergence across ≥50% of network; direct fund drain via VM invariant break (Optimism OVM_ETH class) |
| **High** | Network-wide denial of service (not permanent); temporary freezing of funds or validator slashing; chain reorg enabler; light-client bypass allowing fraudulent state acceptance; node crash reachable by any peer | Amplified P2P DoS that takes down ≥10% of nodes; mempool asymmetric-cost attack forcing full eviction (DETER-class); light-client accepts invalid state proof; RPC endpoint panic crashing node |
| **Medium** | Single-node DoS (not network-wide); significant performance degradation under adversarial conditions; privilege escalation within a node; information disclosure; finality delay without halt; block-propagation slowdown | Malformed message locks one node; mempool exhaustion from a single peer; RPC method leaks sensitive internal state; validator can be slashed via crafted input without losing all stake |
| **Low** | Resource inefficiency; minor state inconsistencies; bugs requiring a trusted position (consensus-level stake, operator access); recoverable misbehavior; log/event correctness issues | Inefficient gossip causing bandwidth waste; metric counter incorrect; audit-log inconsistency; governance vote count off-by-one |
| **Informational** | Code hygiene; best-practice deviations; unused code; documentation mismatches; dead code | Missing error context; goroutine leak in test-only path; dead fork-choice branch; spec-vs-impl naming drift |

## Likelihood categories

| Likelihood tier | Definition | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **High** | Permissionless exploit, no prerequisites, reachable by any network participant or RPC client | Any P2P peer can send the crafted message; any unauthenticated RPC client can trigger the bug |
| **Medium** | Requires specific conditions: particular mempool state, validator subset, epoch boundary, active sync, fork window | Attack needs a fresh sync; needs ≥1 validator to misbehave; requires a specific block range |
| **Low** | Complex setup, multiple stars must align, requires time-bounded race, or sustained adversarial position | Needs a controlled validator for 10+ epochs; needs a sustained eclipse; race with microsecond window; requires >1/3 Byzantine fraction to be already present |

## Base severity = Impact × Likelihood

| | Likelihood: High | Likelihood: Medium | Likelihood: Low |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Impact: Critical** | **Critical** | **High** | **High** |
| **Impact: High** | **High** | **High** | **Medium** |
| **Impact: Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| **Impact: Low** | **Low** | **Low** | **Low** |
| **Impact: Info** | **Informational** | **Informational** | **Informational** |

Note the matrix is **stricter** than the smart-contract matrix for Critical impact + Medium/Low likelihood. This reflects the catastrophic nature of L1 infrastructure failures: a consensus halt remains a severe incident even if the exploit requires specific conditions, because the recovery cost (hard fork, rollback, manual intervention) scales with the blast radius, not the likelihood.

## Modifiers (applied after base matrix)

Modifiers shift the tier by ±1 and stack (floor: Informational, ceiling: Critical).

### Downgrades

| Modifier | Shift | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Requires >1/3 Byzantine stake** | −1 tier | Attack path assumes ownership of consensus-level stake that would cost more than the bounty to acquire honestly |
| **Requires >2/3 Byzantine stake** | −2 tiers | Already-broken trust assumption; the protocol explicitly does not defend against this |
| **Requires fully-trusted role** (governance, emergency key, upgrade admin) | −1 tier (floor: Info) | Trust assumption is documented; attack is a governance concern, not a protocol bug |
| **DoS affects only attacker's own node or resources** | −1 tier (floor: Info) | Self-harm is not a security issue |
| **Testnet-only reachability** | −1 tier | Production impact is bounded; exploits may not port cleanly |
| **Requires on-chain-only observation** (no cross-boundary impact) | −1 tier | Limited to internal state; aligns with smart-contract matrix rule for view-only impact |

### Upgrades

| Modifier | Shift | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Cross-chain or bridge surface with fund-loss path** | +1 tier | Bridges concentrate value and broadcast impact; a medium bug in a bridge is a high bug in practice |
| **Finality-strict chain (Casper FFG, Tendermint BFT, Aptos, Sui)** with finality-affecting bug | +1 tier | Finality violations are unrecoverable without hard fork or social consensus, unlike probabilistic-finality chains |
| **Attacker has source control** (forked client, validator operator, relay operator) | +1 tier | Attacker can modify client behavior on top of exploiting the bug; compound impact |
| **Permissionless exploit requires zero stake** | +1 tier if base ≥ Medium | Fully public attack surface; no economic friction |
| **Exploit reachable from an unauthenticated RPC endpoint** | +1 tier if base ≥ Medium | RPC is typically the most exposed attack surface |

## Immunefi verbatim classification (Round 4)

Source: [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System v2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). These are the reference tier definitions Plamen aligns to.

### Critical (Level 4)

- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)
- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork)
- Direct loss of funds
- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hard fork)

### High (Level 3)

- Unintended chain split (network partition)
- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by ≥500% of average block time
- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters
- RPC API crash affecting projects with ≥25% of the market capitalization on top of the respective layer

### Medium (Level 2)

- Increasing network processing node resource consumption by at least 30% without brute force actions
- Shutdown of ≥30% of network processing nodes without brute force actions (does not shut down the network)
- Bug in the respective layer 0/1/2 network code resulting in unintended smart contract behavior with no concrete funds at direct risk

### Low (Level 1)

- Shutdown of >10% and <30% of network processing nodes without brute force actions
- Modification of transaction fees outside design parameters

### Bounty caps (observational)

- Critical Blockchain/DLT bugs typically capped at 10% of funds directly affected, with a USD 250,000 maximum on many programs.
- Exceptional programs exceed the cap: Optimism paid $2,000,042 for Saurik's SELFDESTRUCT; Polkadot/Frontier paid $1M for pwning.eth's truncation; Moonbeam paid $1M + $50k for the delegatecall bug; NEAR paid $150k for Zellic's "Ping of Death" pre-auth handshake panic.

### Explicit exclusions (Immunefi program-wide)

Typically **out-of-scope** for bounty payouts but **in-scope for Plamen audits** (report as Low / Info with a note):

- Basic economic / governance attacks (51% control, oracle data manipulation, liquidity gaming, Sybil)
- Theoretical-only bugs without a working PoC
- Bugs in testnets only
- Known issues documented in the release notes

## Plamen calibration adjustments (from Round 4)

Round 4 research on real bug outcomes informs these calibration decisions:

1. **Eclipse attacks default to Medium**, upgraded to High only if the attacker can reach ≥30% of nodes cheaply. Matches Immunefi treatment.
2. **Mempool asymmetric DoS (DETER / MemPurge class) maps to High** per the "process transactions beyond set parameters" Immunefi clause.
3. **RPC crash without chain impact is High only if** the affected client has ≥25% market share. Single-client RPC crashes on minority clients drop to Medium.
4. **"Brute force" language**: attacks requiring majority stake or >$X cost to execute are downgraded one tier. Plamen's Byzantine-stake modifier in the table above already encodes this.
5. **Single-client consensus violations** (where other clients continue validating) are High, not Critical. A Critical chain split requires the majority of clients to diverge. Example: the Prysm Fusaka bug (Dec 2025) was High because 9 other clients kept validating.
6. **Pre-auth panic is always High or Critical** on reachability grounds. The NEAR "Ping of Death" was rated CVSS 8.8 ($150k) because any network peer could kill any node with one packet.
7. **Latent dead-code findings are capped at High**. Code that exists but is not currently reachable in production (dead branches, `#[cfg]`-gated paths excluded from the build, `if false { ... }` blocks, behaviorally-equivalent dead implementations like the Run 7 Thorough C-12 "CUDA dead-code one refactor away from live fork") may represent a structural defect, but it is NOT currently exploitable. A latent finding cannot be Critical unless a PoC demonstrates a realistic activation path within the audited commit. Document the activation precondition in the Severity rationale.
8. **Bundle-incomplete findings are PARTIAL by default**. A finding that flags one missing field in a multi-field validation bundle (e.g. "block.timestamp not validated") MUST cite the §3d Validation-Bundle artifact OR be marked PARTIAL until the full enumeration is performed. This prevents one-field-and-stop reporting.

## Severity rationale field

Every L1 finding MUST include a **Severity rationale** field that cites:

1. The impact cell (e.g., "Impact: High — network-wide DoS from single peer")
2. The likelihood cell (e.g., "Likelihood: Medium — requires peer to be connected during sync window")
3. Any modifiers applied (e.g., "+1 for unauthenticated RPC surface")
4. The resulting tier (e.g., "= High")

This makes grading auditable and makes disagreements mechanically resolvable in review.
